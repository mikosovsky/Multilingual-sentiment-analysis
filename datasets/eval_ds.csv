"I have stayed at this hotel several times while in New York and I am always impressed with the service and the value. This past trip, I met the Reservations Manager, Scott Calderon, at the front desk, who knew my name and wanted to make sure I was happy. He came away from the desk to shake my hand. I was very impressed with his professionalism and courtesy.
This hotel is on Broadway (which is a busy thoroughfare) and from inside, it is very quiet and restful. The lobby has a good energy, they play nice music, there is a small business center, and you sense the hustle and bustle of a fun place to stay. Although, once you are in your room, you feel like you have found a place to rest and relax.
The bellmen and housekeepers are very friendly. You can recognize a good hotel, from the look on the housekeeper's face. If they are happy, then you will be happy. The rooms are very clean, very quiet, and I always have a good nights sleep.
Basically, this place is a great value. I will continue to frequent this well run hotel.",positive,en,2
"Now look, I won't lie to you, but I only got this movie for $3.99 from a friend because it had Danni Filth, the lead singer of the ever popular death metal band ""Cradle Of Filth"" in it. I expected of course violence and gore at its finest, as that is what Mr Filth can be portrayed as, amongst a plot line.But dear god, I was oh so wrong. This movie seriously bites, big time. Being a low budget film (haha, wait, make that ZERO BUDGET), this obviously lacks the beautiful Howard Stern orchestra musical scores and the Spielberg special effects. Nope, it's all one camera, bad angles, and bad blood scenes.Take for example when our star and violent fiend, Mr Filth, violently kills a mugger. A grab at the throat, and blood spits out, but oh my, it looks like there's a juice packet filled with fake blood in the man's shirt.To you Cradle Of Filth fans: You'll hear two songs throughout the movie, but with the camera angles and shoddy filming, they drag the overall pleasure of the song DOWN.My final comment: Steer well away from it. It's blood, gore, breasts, and hey, even a shoddy story to go with it. So if you like appalling violence, near no voices (yes, there's hardly any words in this movie), then by all means, buy it. But if shoddy movies isn't your thing, then avoid it. Don't waste your money.",negative,en,0

"Was here for a meeting that didn't happen. Nothing to do with the restaurant. \n\nDecided to stay for lunch.

Also, the portions are a lot smaller than most Mexican restaurants. \n\nThey did NOT change for more chips. Probably would be doing me a favor if they did. The chips were very good 5. Almost seemed like they were baked instead of fried.\n\nService was a little slow but very good and friendly. \n\nWould I come back here? If I wanted Mexican food and I was in the area, I might.

"For those of us who are part of the real world of ballet - this film is completely ridiculous. Ivan Kirov was basically a gymnast, not a ballet dancer. Viola Essen at the time was with Ballet Theater, now American Ballet Theater, and a reasonably good dancer, but except for Dame Judith Anderson, the acting is amateurish and Checkov is completely over the top .... embarrassingly so! I saw this film at age 14 and at that time, never having seen a ballet, I was very impressed. However, later in life, long after I had completed my own career as a dancer - I purchased the video tape of it, curious as to what it was like after so many years. I couldn't believe how naive Hollywood could be about the world of ballet. But it was made in the mid 40s, before The Red Shoes or The Turning Point, the latter giving a true picture of the ballet world. The entire cast of Spectre have now passed away ... Ivan Kirov (not his real name)dying at age 79. It was his one and only film, thereafter being kept by a Chicago business man .. so the rumor goes.",negative,en,0

"So while looking for a local Chinese spot for take out I found respectable reviews for this spot. I have probably driven by it hundreds of times while going up 32nd St. after passing McDowell but before Thomas but never payed any mind to it. \n\nI gave it three stars and some easy fixes could make it four. To start the young woman answering the phone was friendly, smart and helpful. I told her I was on yelp looking at pictures of previous menus since the old website was dead(just submitted request for yelp mod to update). She told me the new site and helped me pick dishes and said food ready will be ready in less than ten minutes. When I get there it was ready but since they have only have two phone lines I had to wait 5-10 minutes until the card could be processed. The majority of the crew is Asian the manager/owner looks to be something other than Asian , likely eastern European middle Eastern. He was taking an order and someone in house was talking on the other line so no way to have my payment go through. He apologized and thanked me for my patience. \n\nOrdered Spicy chicken wings came with free egg rolls. Beijing style Hot & Sour Chichken and Mongolian Beef. Came out to about 20 bucks. \n\nWings appeared fried with very light batter and some type of chili sauce drizzled across the top. Though it doesnt sound exciting I would get it again. The egg rolls were big and even though they were free I wouldn't mind paying for them next time. The chicken dish had like an orange chicken vibe more doughy not a lotta flavor. As you can see very generous portion but not my style. The mongolian beef had a good sauce and as you can see is mostly white onions shallots and beef. The beef was cooked right decent cut but I onions to beef ratio was opposite of what I expected. \n\nI hope to find some new dishes to try that I like.",negative,en,0

"My family of four (2 adults, 2 children) stayed at the Marriott during a ""mini-vaca"" of two day in Indianapolis. We picked this hotel due to its vicinity to the canal district and price, which was very reasonable in comparison to others in the area. We reserved a package that included free parking (the hotel has gated, private parking that costs $19 per day) and breakfast for 2 adults and 2 children.
Check-in process was fast and friendly. I had requested early check-in, and when we arrived at noon on Friday, the room was ready.
The combination lobby/bistro area is ultra-modern and inviting. Technology is available to check in for flights, find out what there is to do in the area, etc.
We did not use the pool or fitness room, but quick peeks showed both to be clean and maintained.
I believe this hotel has recently been refurbished...and it shows. The colors are bright, but not garish, and comfortable. Hallways are clean.
Our room was a king with a sofa bed. Comfortable size, and layed out very well. Everything was clean. That's all I can ask for, really.
My one negative comment would be: If I reserve a room and specifically state that we are 2 adults and 2 children, I expect to have 4 bath towels and 4 washcloths available. I shouldn't have to request extra from the front desk. But, that's what I did, because there were only 3 of each in the room.
As I stated, our package included breakfast, so I don't know what the Bistro breakfast typically costs - I imagine it's not cheap, but probably comparable to others in the area. The food, itself, is good. I did not have anything prepared, choosing yogurt, a banana, and cereal, but my husband did have a breakfast sandwhich. And, while he was not overly impressed, he said it was good. My kids were satisfied - and that's definitely a plus, as a parent! :-)
Overall, I would recommend this hotel highly.",positive,en,2

"'Where the Sidewalk Ends (1950)' opens, appropriately, with Dana Andrews' and Gene Tierneys' names inscribed on the sidewalk, as dirty water streams down between the bars of a sewer grate. The sidewalk represents respectability, integrity and morality  only crooks and delinquents walk in the gutter. But even the most honourable of men have a tendency to misstep on occasion, and, when the sidewalk abruptly comes to an end, sometimes it proves impossible to avoid getting one's shoes wet. Mark Dixon (Dana Andrews) was born in the gutter, his father a professional criminal, and has spent his entire life clawing his way back onto the sidewalk, perpetually balanced on the edge of the kerb. As a police detective, Dixon wants nothing more than to display the decency and integrity that his father lacked, but he possesses a mean-streak that he can't escape. When his quick temper leaves a murder suspect dead, Dixon finds himself becoming the very father whom he despised, a cheap criminal who'll cheat and lie to cover up his offence.'Where the Sidewalk Ends' was the only film to reunite Dana Andrews, Gene Tierney and director Otto Preminger after the superb 'Laura (1944),' though the two films, as far as noir goes, couldn't be further apart. Whereas the earlier picture had the strong intimacy of a country-house murder tale, this film is more conventional as a gritty urban police drama. Given her ravishingly memorable performance as Laura Hunt, it's unfortunate that here Tierney is grossly underused, occupying the typical niche of the pretty, helpless romantic interest {much as she did that same year in Jules Dassin's 'The Night and the City (1950)'}. Andrews, on the other hand, has rarely been better, exhibiting a toughness and unhinged anger that I hadn't expected of him. Gary Merrill is suitably smug as the crime boss Scalise, but he doesn't seem mean enough for the role, and I think that an actor like Richard Conte (who played Mr. Brown in 'The Big Combo (1955)') would have better suited the character; I hadn't realised this, but Conte appeared just one year earlier in Preminger's 'Whirlpool (1949).'The tension, as Dixon attempts to cover up his accidental crime, is absolutely riveting  certainly among the most suspenseful sequences of its era  though I feel that the situation still wasn't exploited to its full potential. The taxi driver is the only person who could have decisively identified Dixon as the perpetrator, but Preminger hurriedly skims over the moment when he passes Dixon on the stairs. Had the witness been brought in as Dixon was re-enacting his own movements outside the apartment entrance, we could have had some genuine fireworks. And why, for that matter, couldn't the taxi driver's testimony have immediately absolved Jiggs Taylor (Tom Tully) from suspicion of murder? Niggling inconsistencies such as these tarnish an otherwise excellent screenplay from Ben Hecht, who infuses his gritty criminal underworld with hard-hitting cops and wise-cracking felons. Andrews' seething and implosive law-enforcer, tormented by rage and remorse, has rarely been done better, at least the equal of Robert Ryan in Nicholas Ray's 'On Dangerous Ground (1952).'",positive,en,2

It's got Potential! Plenty of Outdoor seating too, Great designs, this place is cool!\n\nChips and Salsa: I LOVE great Salsa! This one is better than A-OK and I guess I can say I'm a fan, though barely! Even so, this Salsa is better than many I have tasted in the Charlotte area.

I'm telling my waitress what I'm thinking and she makes suggestions: I could get Two Tacos instead of three (on the menu they are listed as three) I could get one of each instead of choosing just one flavor and I could get a different wrapper instead of Corn Flour! So I'm IMPRESSED! I order two of one and one of the other! I'm glad I ordered two of the Steak with White Onions it was very good! I want to forget the other one!

The different Salsa or Sauce they served on the side (thankfully) was awful and I ate more of it than I should, just to be sure it was terrible (I hope they get rid of it and invent a new one)!

"My daughter (13) and I stayed at the Murrary Hill May 29 thru June 5th. Our first bad experience was with the front desk clerk. We checked in around 4pm, were told the room was not quite ready, and given keys and sent up to the room. ""Not quite ready"" was a huge understatement. The room was totally trashed from the previous users, dirty dishes, unmade bed, trash, bad smell. When I went back down to the lobby the desk clerk said ""I told you the room wasn't ready"". Very deadpan, unpleasant individual, I ended up in an argument with him, bad way to start a 5 night stay. Thankfully we did not see him except that one time.
The rooms we saw on the website were large, with separate bed and living quarters, and a kitchen. We got a large room with a couch and eating table in it, and a small kitchen. When we asked for a separate bedroom, because my daughter went to bed a lot earlier than me, but it was made clear that we were priceline customers, and could not upgrade. Our rate was 120.00 per night. The bathroom was small but nicely updated. The doormen were very nice, the maidservice was good. Elevators are small but adequate, the gym is nice, and the laundry room came in handy, 1.50 to wash and 1.50 to dry. The dryers get really hot so be carefull with your delicates! All in all was not terribly impressed. Past the lobby it seemed like a Motel 6 or any other lower end room. But I guess that's New York. The W down the street looks so much better.",negative,en,0

"This store is pretty awesome. I love world markets. To be honest I never go into a world market to do real shopping, I only go in to check out all the cool stuff they have and then buy a couple things. At the back of the store there is always tea and coffee samples. As soon as you walk in you will be greeted by the checkout person at the front counter. You will seriously feel like you are on a travel adventure as you see kimono style stationary note cards, paper lanterns, colorful decorative pillows, artsy paintings and many more ornaments. The back of the store you can get specialty international items, however don't come here trying to find something extremely specific, they only carry the basics. They have Asian, Middle Eastern, European, Latin American food. A great wine selection, I like to read up on the different wine, coffee and teas as they have laminated cards attached to wine/coffee/tea racks. If you need kitchen goods such as plates, bowls and cups, they will also have them here. \n\nAwesome store, fun to come here to relax and kill some time.",neutral,en,1

Dr. Curan and his staff are not just great with kids, they are excellent at communicating thoroughly with parents as well. We never feel rushed or leave with any unanswered questions.

So imagine my surprise when I bit into the pasta to discover...PUMPKIN PIE! Holy nutmeg Batman!

There was no way we could fly home that much later due to other commitments, health issues, and connecting flights so we were forced to take the refund.

"I don't want to come off as spoiled, but who are we kidding, I am. At least when it comes to traveling-my pops is a travel agent and I've been around (the globe, that is-get your minds outta the gutter please!). The Aria offered some promise from the brochures and online photos, but five minutes after walking in, I was cursing myself for even agreeing to come to Vegas. It epitomized everything about the city I hate, and no number of Bottega Veneta or Chanel stores in the adjoining Crystals shopping center can pretend to make it any classier than it is (or totally isn't). Everyone in my group agreed-five of us with various levels of interests, standards and tastes.\n\nThe people staying there generally included guys with hair gelled so high they look 6'3\"" even if their driver's license accurately reads 5'9\"" and girls who yell at the elevator door man for daring to ask that they put on a shirt when they aren't by the pool. They make the folks of Jersey Shore look like Beaver Cleaver and make me want to vomit. \n\nBut let's say you love Snooki and dream of carrying the same ol' tired Louie V. bag that every unoriginal 'fashionista' owns. This hotel still sucks. First the hateful, unfriendly woman at the front desk tried to stick us in a smoking section room despite us being booked in a non-smoking floor. The room had stains all over the duvet and pillowcases, and was tiny. When we spoke to someone much more normal downstairs they moved us to another room, which was clean enough, but nothing special.\n\nThe food was also a disappointment. I ate at the buffet, their cafe twice and all three times was underwhelmed. The buffet has a nice selection and staff is great, but the food is just not worth it. The cafe's menu was incredibly limited and the food was so bland I was feeling separation anxiety for Bellagio's options and general level of standard, despite the beautiful modern decor here.\n\nMkay, so by now you're thinking I am a major bitch. That's only partly true-I simply have no patience for places that tout themselves as luxurious destinations only to offer up a meat-market experience wracked with mediocrity and low standards. This place suffers from a confusion of what it is and what it wants to be. It sucks getting lured into the hype-it's all style, no substance. Though really, that's generally what I think about Vegas itself, so never mind me for not getting it. \n\nThe casino pays out better than some others, so that's cool, but staying here isn't required for that. Other than to hit up some shops (Papillon made the trip by introducing me to the out of control, amazing sunglasses of Thierry Lasry-if you win big it's fun to poke around in here), move along.",negative,en,0

"Came here since friend could get us all comped.\n\nThere's actually a lot of items that are similar to the Seafood buffet but what makes people love Carnival is the selection. There is a lot of stuff and the buffet line is LOOONG. I seriously thought I was at the end until I saw people coming from around the corner. They have everything, seafood (not as grand as Seafood buffet), all different ethnic foods, carvery station, and desserts etc.\n\nAll I did was take a small portion and everything, hoping to try everything out. There's lots of fried items and things that are prepared fairly quickly. Nothing really gourmet here but I do like the stir-fry/Mongolian BBQ station that they have. You can add the ingredients you want and have it cooked on the spot. I liked it so much I went back for it twice. Desserts are also good with cakes, pies, cookies, and even gelato. I tried all their gelato flavors and got to sample all the other pastries.\n\nHowever in the end, it felt like this buffet was slightly lacking in terms of quality. It felt like I was eating fast food for a good part of the menu which was disappointing. It is fairly easy to find something that you'll like since there's such a big selection. Although I also gotta admit, this place is a lot better than many of the buffets on the strip. Too bad you gotta taxi if you didn't drive.\n\nPrice-wise, for the selection it is worth it but if you are expecting something of a higher quality then you might be disappointed.

"I flew to Changi airport, Singapore as part of my journey to Phnom Penh, Cambodia and was very impressed with Singapore Airlines. Even though the in flight entertainment packed up (stopped working) within about 20-30 minutes, possibly less, the staff were super friendly and hospitable (they gave out lots of free drinks to appease the passengers as soon as the screens failed). I ended up with a row to myself which was AWESOME and I was quite comfortable with my back against the window and my feet stretched out along the seats facing the aisle. There’s a cool neck brace/pillow you can get that’s like a plastic neck support covered in polar fleece that you place under your chin then wrap around your neck and secure with Velcro. When you nod off, your neck and head are supported so you can nap comfortably and when you wake up you don’t have a stiff neck! I don’t think there’s a place to review those here but I got one from Wish and it was so helpful! I’d definitely recommend Singapore Airlines as it’s the most luxurious flight I’ve ever had.

"Stayed at this hotel for 5 days while attending a businss conference. While the hotel is new and clean its interior and common areas are very modern and sterile. Too sterile. The rooms are nice, however, sterile as well. The second bed in the room had not been changed, I found debris in the sheets, the comfortor had make-up stains. The shower head could be found in any Motel 6. I parked a car in the garage ($21 per day) and prepaid for 2 days. I turned the car into the Hertz desk after the first day and was refunded one day parking on my bill. Every day after that I was charged $42 which was refunded (an automatic computer entry I was told). The restaurant and bar were very expensive, I didn't ever venture into either. The Fox Sports Bar was the chosen spot. There is not an entrance to the Fox Sports Bar from the hotel, one must go outside to enter (explained that Fox rents space from Hilton). Staff there were young, most were helpful but inexperienced in treating people friendly. The conciere at the hotel was the most curt unprofessional person I have ever encoutered at a conciere desk. She was efficient, however. Hilton needs to find a polite and friendly person to put at that desk and that would not be the blonde, thin, female that was working when I was there. The front desk people are usually working on a computer when you approach and are seemingly too busy to help those waiting. No check out process except to approach this desk. The conference wait staff is the exception, they are very polite, greet you in hallways, and are very helpful. To end this review, Hilton, you need to take a look at this hotel, send most everyone to a customer service school, work out the union issues, and buy a bouquets of flowers for the common areas to soften the blow of modernism and sterility.

"HOW CAN I FORGET TO REVIEW XS LAS VEGAS OH MY GOD.\n\nI went to Vegas back in August of this year and it was absolutely the best time of my life! My friends and I went to XS on a Monday night for \""Dim Mak\"" Mondays to see of course, the one and only Steve Aoki! It was hands down, the best time in a nightclub I had in awhile. I'm from NYC and saying this means A LOT. You know NYC has a lot of great clubs and such but nothing, NOTHING compared to XS. We had free champagne thanks to Aoki's performance and of course some free cake! (Aoki fans know what I'm talking about!) \n\nAdmission for ladies was free of course, especially if you know a promoter. The ratio thing is a really big deal, and I don't blame promoters for asking for a lot of girls because a room full of dudes could get kinda weird. My guy friends paid $20 to get in, probably better than some guys who didn't have any promoter buddies and ended up paying up $40-$60 .. just to get in. So get a promoter, boys and a lot of girlies.

"The name says it all. The hotel is situated directly on Times Square, unlike many area hotels that make the same claim, but are actually located a few blocks away.
I usually stay at hotels in SoHo or other neighborhoods that aren't so busy, but my Midwestern friend wanted to be in the heart of the Big Apple. His wish was granted. <grin>
Overall, my stay was good. I requested a higher floor with nice views and my expectations were met. The size of the room was typical for Manhattan - no room for even a chair but enough space for our belongings. When I needed various items (silverware, extra towels, etc.), the housemen delivered them in a timely manner.
The positive and negative aspects of the hotel (IMHO) are the following:
Positive
1) I loved the decor (especially the ground floor waterfall) and high energy music. Stepping off the elevator Saturday night and hearing ""No Diggity"" (don't laugh!) blaring in the popular lobby bar got me ready for a night out on the town. If you're looking for Ritz-Carlton decor and Wilson Phillips/Enya/John Tesh songs playing softly in the lobby, this ain't the place for you.
2) The views, if you're in staying in certain rooms, are spectacular; especially if you're still a small-town boy/girl at heart and love seeing ""big buildings"".
3) If you want to see one of the countless Broadway shows in the surrounding area, you can't beat the location, natch.
4) The complimentary ride (minus gratuity) to Penn Station in the hotel's Acura was greatly appreciated.
5) The bellman who assisted us upon arrival was very friendly and didn't seem to pressure us for a tip. We still gave him one, of course.
Negative
1) Minus the aforementioned housemen and bellman, most staff I encountered were aloof and rarely made eye contact. (example: upon arrival, a doorman grabbed one of our bags from the taxi; my $5 tip didn't even result in a simple ""thank you"" or smile) Maybe it's the hipness factor of where they work, but still, your main responsibility is to make sure each guest feels welcomed.
2) If you're sharing a room, I hope you're comfortable with him or her seeing the blurred details of you stepping out of the shower or answering nature's call. The sliding door wasn't really an issue, but the blurred ""glass"" wall-like partition led to a bathroom lights-off policy when one of us needed some privacy.
3) This isn't the hotel's fault, mind you, but if you want access to nearby affordable restaurants and convenience stores, this is probably not the best place for you. (examples: a pack of cigarettes at a Times Square retailer is $4 more than a nearby store; the Times Square locations of Olive Garden and TGI Friday's, places I wouldn't frequent anyway, mark up their food by nearly 50%)
Despite the staff and exhibitionist-friendly bathroom, I recommend this hotel for first-time visitors to NYC or theatergoers. I'll probably choose the nearby Westin or Chatwal hotels on my next trip though.
Full disclosure: I'm a Starwood employee, but my stay was not business-related, I don't know any of the W New York - Times Square employees, and no one has asked me to write this review.",positive,en,2

"Positive -This hotel has LARGE rooms as compared to many other hotels in the area. The only disappointment we experienced was the housekeeping. Twice we came back after a day of sightseeing to a room where the iron and ironing board weren't put away, the bed wasn't made completely, and the fold out couch/bed wasn't a 'couch'. We expected to see a room as pictured/discribed. One where we wanted to sit and relax. The minimal was done - I could have and did do better to make it comfortable for our family. Who wants to straighten beds and couches on vacation? After speaking to the manager the first time I expected better the next day. Unfortunately, it wasn't. The housekeeping staff need to finish the room correctly and NOT assume what the guest wants. Personally, I like to see the decorative pillows back on the bed and not the floor as well as the throw blanket on the foot of the bed and having a couch to sit on. Little things that make the room seem clean and pleasant weren't done. However, when I did bring this to the manager's attention the first day and the next (as I expected it to be better); she immediately handled the situation that surpassed our expectation.
Positive - Staff very friendly & helpful.
Positive - Location is wonderfully close to shopping and restaurants. Many homeless are around but they are friendly and non-threatening.
Positive - Adjusted parking fee, option to be 'green' with towels/linen with a $5 hotel reward card for doing so",negative,en,0

"I always try to search out good Italian restaurants and it is a little difficult in kl as many are not run by Italians. Opus has always had great reviews and so I thought I would try. I tried several times to just rock up without a reservation and never succeeded ( weekdays - not weekends) so I assumed it must be really good! How wrong. I went with a female friend and we again tried with no reservation and luckily they had a small table for 2 outside, which is no issue. What was an issue is the risotto I ordered, risotto is a basic Italian dish, albeit it does take a little care and attention but this was simply terrible. It was more like Nasi goreng (local fried rice). When I complained the waitress was completely indifferent and didn't show any concern whatsoever.they obviously asked if I wanted to change etc etc but that's not the point.

"I had a very enjoyable breakfast and TOPH. Good food, no frills. We got there about 10 am on a Sunday morning. Initially, I was surprised it is next to a Motel 6. Not surprisingly, the place was packed. There seems to be a shortage of breakfast joints in the valley. It took about 30 minutes to get a table, but the turnover rate was acceptable considering how many people were ahead of us. The server came immediately to get our drink orders as we settled in. I finally decided on the apple pancake and I am glad I did. Light and fluffy and not too sweet. I got the junior size and I couldn't even finish that. Luckily, my dining-mates helped me finish it off. The regular size would be good for sharing. Something else I noticed is that the portion size for the other meals did not seem that big. I was afraid to get the eggs, meat, and pancake combo, but I think even a petite girl like me can handle it. Some last talking points: The decor is very retro homey. The service is good even with the crowd. Parking is adequate for Scottsdale. And remember to bring cash.",neutral,en,1

The lack of a closet is a bit odd - you basically hang your clothes on hooks on the wall. Only a ""rain"" shower head in the bathroom - so good if you like those things. The rest of my criticisms might be quibbles, but they bugged me; no ability to put things in the fridge (electronically monitored minibar), coffee cups but no coffee maker, wood floor was dirty (the bottom of my feet were black after walking around) and in the fitness area of the hotel there were no towels (not even by the hot tub) and no wipes to sanitize the exercise machines. And finally, what's the point of having a high-end Samsung TV in the room if the picture is stuck on ""stretch""?

The horrible service explains why it is never busy when we've gone. Which is unfortunate because we love the food.

"Flew American Eagle from Columbus to New York. There is a vast contrast between flying American Airlines mainline and American Eagle. American Eagle (AE) is to be avoided if you have any other option, especially if your route uses one of their old embraer or bombardier planes that insist on gate checking roll on bags, CRJ700, ERJ140 and ERJ145. American Airlines mainline are my airline of choice especially when flying internationally. I fly AE in and out of Columbus frequently to connect with the AA mainline international flights. I used to book Delta Connect (DC) flights on separate tickets to avoid AE but the DC schedules changed making that option impractical. As examples, with AE you have a 50/50 chance of arriving in Columbus and having to wait a couple of hundred yards back from the gate for about 10 minutes until the below wing ground handlers saunter out of their break room to marshall the aircraft onto stand. You can then wait an average of 15-20 minutes to have your gate checked bag delivered back to the jet bridge. DC normally do this in under 3 minutes for the same aircraft type. If you hold check a bag you better allow yourself a full 45 minutes before it will be delivered on the carousel. With any weather disruptions anywhere in the AA network they will delay and cancel the AE flights, especially the flights in and out of their 2nd tier bases, to the benefit of the mainline and hub flights. Then you will get a shrug of the shoulders from their staff and a statement that because it is weather related the airline bears no responsibility for any delays etc.. You will have about a 20% chance of a maintenance issue on any given flight with this older fleet. Normally it will take 20 minutes to fix the issue and then typically an hour to update the maintenance logbook before you journey can continue. It is unfortunate that the AE below wing operations are so bad as their above wing staff do appear to hustle and to be nice to the passengers.",negative,en,0

"Intelligent, wry, and thrilling, ""The Invisible Man"" stood out in 2000 among Sci-Fi's usual lineup, balancing out ""Farscape""'s fantastical art direction and sometimes melodramatic script with gritty, cynical plots and modern noir dialogue. The show sat between ""Law and Order"" and ""Doctor Who"" on the believability meter, but there was no denying the fact that ""I-Man""'s characters went beyond caricature. Even characters that verged on predictability like the Keeper, the Official, and Eberts were given reprieves from the formulaic. Paul Ben-Victor and Vincent Ventresca had a chemistry that evolved and shifted elegantly, made even more remarkable by the revolving door team of writers and directors. The effects are never allowed to overwhelm the plot, and the science only sometimes verged on the totally unbelievable. The show's low points are still entertaining, and I've never seen such taut pilot episodes. Matt Greenberg and Sci-Fi should be commended, and fans have the right to demand a comprehensive DVD edition of the show. Every time I come across a marathon of ""Hercules: The Legendary Journeys"" on Sci-Fi, I roll my eyes and sigh, mourning the excitement and possibility of science fiction television that ""Invisible Man"" and its ilk represented.",positive,en,2

"Bottom line- this club is MISERABLE if you don't have a table. For guys, no big deal. You can jump around just fine. For girls in gorgeous, blindingly painful high heels, this is a problem. \n\nThere is ZERO space to move or walk around. If you find a spot to hang your hat, bouncers will tell you to keep moving. Other reviews say \""if you are a girl, hope that some guys invite you to a table.\"" Chances are there are 100 girls hotter (by Vegas definition) than you and me in this club... I've seen them with my own eyes there. The girls that work there also fit into this category.\n\nHakkasan has the most incredible DJs headlining, no doubt. That is the only reason why people go. Unless you have a hard-on for Tiesto and have been dying to see him (like me), I would pick another club. It's not a pleasant clubbing experience without a table here. \n\nI also have a problem with one of the bartenders. You see, I used to bartend and always count the pours at each club I go to. I was surprised she was pouring 4-count (1 oz) drinks for $16 apiece. I would expect at least 1.25 in this town. When I asked what the pour was, she told me 1.5, and I asked her why she was pouring one ouncers instead. This is unacceptable.

"Stayed here on a recent trip to Las Vegas from 11/15/2014 to 11/18/2014. You should be aware that this is a budget casino located in the suburbs and thus both the casino and the hotel won't be anything near what you'll find on the Strip, but I really enjoyed my stay here!\n\nThe hotel is located on the upper levels, and downstairs, there's practically everything you could ever need - a pool, a Subway, a Starbucks, even a 12-screen movie theater. The Festival Buffet is average quality, but good for the price. I don't gamble so I can't speak to the quality of the slot machines or games, but there was a large variety of gambling activities available in both smoking and non-smoking sections.\n\nIn terms of the actual hotel, overall, it was a great experience. I stayed in a king-sized suite for about $35 a night, and the room was nice and spacious. A few things could be improved, however:\n\n1. The bathroom light seems to have a motion sensor, and thus, the light would go out while I was in the middle of the shower. This would happen about once every 10-15 minutes or so, and I'd literally have to step out of the shower soaking wet to turn the light back on.\n2. As this is primarily a casino and secondarily a hotel (and a budget one at that), there were no toiletries available at the front desk as you would normally find in a traditional hotel. I forgot toothpaste at home and had to buy a new tube rather than take a free one from the reception desk as you would ordinarily do in a hotel. Shampoo, soap, and body lotion were provided, however.\n\nOther than that, an excellent stay for the price. The Strip is only about 15-20 minutes away, and Hoover Dam/the Arizona border is about 30 minutes! Overall, excellent and convenient.\n\nP.S. Try the banana nut French toast at the Fiesta Caf\u00e9!",neutral,en,1

"This Sheraton is nice but really nothing special. It was lacking in a few basic things in the room (like an extra blanket, pillow and there were no robes) you’d expect a “4 star” hotel to have. Also we utilized the wifi in the hotel and they unknowingly charged us $11 to use it. I called downstairs and explained that there was nothing that indicated we would be charged (also I have a data plan on my phone too!). Eventually they begrudgingly took the charge off. The clerk who answered the phone said they would “just this one time,” and acted as if they were doing me a HUGE favor.

The continental breakfast was outstanding. The best part was the service. During check-in, the employee overhead it was my daughter's birthday the next day.

"This was the most expensive of the four hotels we stayed in on our recent trip to the USA. It was also by far the worst. From the moment we entered the reception area we had a sinking feeling. Our fears were realised when we opened the door to our room. It was so small that only one person could move around at once and the other person had to put their legs on the bed so the other one could get by. There was a broken venetian blind covering the window. This had to be kept closed all the time as there were other rooms immediately opposite (see photo). The beds were only about a foot apart. The wardrobe was very small and there were no drawers. There were no coffee making facilities and no room safe. Neither were safety deposit facilities available at reception, meaning we had to carry all our valuables round with us. Even though we were five floors up we could hear the noise of the subway trains all the time. The best part of our room was the bathroom, which was quite large by comparison, though the towels were rather threadbare. The room was very stuffy but the air con made a terrible noise. As mentioned in previous reviews, the lift was very small and we often waited 5 mins for it to arrive.
The hotel is a long way from the centre of Manhattan, necessitating a subway or taxi ride.
There is a deli nearby which serves a reasonable breakfast, and also a bar 3 blocks away. There is also an excellent supermarket opposite the bar.
The only saving grace about this hotel was that the beds and towels were clean, or we would not have stayed there.",negative,en,0

I had to demand a new hotel room twice. It was late by the time I checked into the resort. I opened the door and discovered there was no power in the room. The light from outside also revealed food and stains on the walls. My husband demanded a new clean room with power. The second room had food and stains smeared on the walls. The drawers and table were broken. I pulled back the blankets on the bed and discovered mold growing on the bed! The sheets were also stained badly. My husband explained the situation at the front desk and again demanded a different room. The wall in the kitchen of the third room was stained. The stain appeared as though an animal (hopefully not a person) had urinated on the wall. The sink was rusted and contained chunks of a green substance. The couch was torn. My parents were also staying at the hotel. There room was similar. I offered to share our room with them. After thoroughly checking the pull out bed I discovered brown smears all over the sheets. The sheets on the bed were also stained. The lamps in the room contained thick layers of dust and cobwebs. In the morning I stepped outside and saw the house keeper. She was carrying a medium size canvas bag to clean rooms. I do not believe the house keepers change the sheets ever. Nor do I believe they actually clean anything! I was very disgusted with the entire experience. I honestly do believe health regulations are not being upheld at this hotel! Mold on the bed and food smeared on the wall.

The restaurant was covered in beige, brown, copper, & red colors with splashes of bright neon blue emanating from the center of the restaurant from its circular bar. I loved the lively atmosphere of the space but, in the end, I wasn't won over by either the service or the food. I guess I expected a lot more \""BAM!\"" from this James Beard award-winner celebrity chef but, instead, every dish out of the kitchen was fairly bland & unmemorable: from the gumbo, chowder, fish & meat dishes to the desserts (I got to try a little of everyone's dish).

"I struggled hard with this one.
I really loved Gage's character in the first two books of the Deadly Beauties with Alyssa. When I read this was going to be his story of course I was salivating! I really wasn't ever a huge fan of Kane despite being where the earlier series ended up so I was beyond excited to see my favorite, Gage, fall in love. However, I'm very sad to say it wasn't really redeemable after how things ended in the Deadly Beauties original series. I always saw Gage as the hopeless romantic I mean he did so many things trying to obtain Alyssa's love... He doesn't do even a fraction of that for Kimber. He pushes her away, has her the first time at a succubus induced party, he doesn't seem to return her love despite us hearing how he falls in love so deeply, I didn't feel it. (Hearing about his first two loves could have been used to propel his love for Limber but instead it felt like those two loves were greater romances than his love for Kimber.) If that makes sense, I more felt like I was being told he was deeply in love. Kimber was a pretty good character, except I felt embarrassed for her more times than I could count. I'm just not sure C. M. Owens did the best thing by making Gage end up with Kimber, Alyssa's adopted sister. He loved Alyssa and I think if she had ended up with Gage & Kane it would have been better. Honestly this entire book I just felt bad for Kimber like she was an Alyssa stand in. In the book Gage actually says ""We’ve been here for two weeks, and Kimber is more mine than anyone has ever been."" I'm not sure why that sentence put me off so much, I guess because he really just wanted someone to love him back so badly he'd accept anyone. It felt like for once he wanted someone to love him more than he loved them... Poor Kimber. Ugh. This was not my favorite, I just don't think Gage should have had his own story not with the lengths he went through to get another woman in the other books. But hey that's just my opinion, if you haven't read those then you won't see the same things & you might genuinely enjoy this book. Overall though, it made me a little sad, I never quite felt Kimber was the love of Gage's life despite how the author tried to tell us she was... Idk 2.5 stars for me. One last thing I never minded the ""smirk"" thing in the first series but every other sentence had someone smirking or winking. It became a bit over the top. Still love C. M. Owens and I'll read Thad's story but I might stop there if things don't get a bit more exciting.",neutral,en,1

"I was very disappointed with this hotel. I had booked my reservation far in advance, and I called on check-in day to ensure that my reservation would be held for late check-in. Despite this, I was told upon arrival that the hotel had been overbooked and that I would have to go elsewhere.
To the hotel's credit, they had arranged for accomodation at a nearby hotel with a comparable star rating. However, that substitute hotel was quite far from the downtown nightlife, and it was the proximity to downtown nightlife that had convinced me to choose the San Diego Marriott Gaslamp Quarter in the first place.
I wasn't the only one turned away that night. When I pulled up to valet my car, the kind valet told me that I should check with the front desk before bothering to take my luggage out of the trunk, because he had seen many, many people get turned away that night.
My advice: be careful when booking at this hotel. A reservation(even one paid in full in advance, as mine was) doesn't necessarily mean that you will be staying here.",negative,en,0

"We've been to the W Union Square 3-4 times and always liked it for the location, decor, and service. We've stayed in a variety of rooms, and one time where I slipped someone $60 when checking in, got a great upgrade. Recently though when we checked in, we hated the room. It felt empty for the larger size we got, and the decor was very cold - faded blue and orange on white, with no art on the walls. When we asked if we could be moved to a room with the ""new decor"" - what we remembered to be plush beige and purple velvets, they said the blue and orange was brand new across the hotel. Yuck! I'm sure they tested and researched it, but it's definately not to our taste. And they have a new policy with the sheets which is to have a built-in moisture barrier (like sheets for toddlers who wet the bed) as part of the mattress pad. My husband was fine with it, but I woke up in a sweat every night because the bed didn't breathe or wick. When I called down they said it was on all the beds and that my only option was to take off the mattress pad (I should have).
One problem we generally have with this hotel (which was likely rehabbed from a very old building) is that there is a small air vent near the window. It gets about 50% covered by the curtain (which originates next to it and can't be moved aside to expose the whole vent. So the rooms are generally stuffy and uneven temps. Seems like an easy enough fix to at least allow the vent to not be covered by the curtain.

It tasted like crab salad, basically crab and mayonnaise and was served with triscuits, we did not taste or see any bacon or corn in it, it was a small serving too, definitely not worth the $9. We also ordered the eggplant sandwich and crispy potatoes. The eggplant sandwich was okay, the goat cheese and pickled onions had good flavor, but you couldn't really tell there was eggplant on it, the bread was nothing great either, basic supermarket french bread. The crispy potatoes had good flavor, but they were drowning in oil, super greasy and our stomachs didn't appreciate it after eating these.

The set design is imaginative and troubling, the staging of scenes maintains your attention, while adding to your own sense of confusion and terror. The acting is outstanding, with Alan Rickman and Madeleine Stowe having the duty of carrying every scene.I first saw this film in 1991, soon after it came out on video. It didn't play in theaters where I lived; not surprising, given its political content. It should be seen, though. It features a brilliant staging of the torture and interrogation techniques used by repressive societies to instill fear and obedience in its citizens. The country is never named, which makes it all the more striking. It could be anywhere; East, West, 3rd World, 1st World. It illustrates what happens when a small group of people decide what is best for everyone; when government becomes the ruler of the citizens, rather than the servant.Madeleine Stowe is a children's author who has been dragged from her bed in the night and subjected to terror and torture. She finds herself in a room with Alan Rickman, a seemingly pleasant functionary. At first it seems a horrible mistake and she is free to go; but, fear causes her to remain and the terror escalates. She is increasingly subjected to physical and mental torture. The interrogator uses sensory deprivation, temporal manipulation, confusion, auditory manipulation, role play, and twisted logic to break down the author. She is humiliated and browbeaten, forced to endure strenuous bodily positions, deprived of food and water.Through it all, she refuses to give in; to do what the interrogator asks. She is told that it will all end if she just signs a confession. A simple little act. She refuses. Through it all, she employs defense mechanisms that have developed since childhood. It is slowly revealed that she was the victim of childhood sexual abuse. To survive, she developed fantasy worlds and characters that would take her away from the abuse. These mechanisms allow her to transcend her torture and turn the tables on her interrogator. She starts attacking his own beliefs and profession, forcing him to examine his own life and motives. In the end, she is free, because she maintains the freedom of thought. The interrogator is the one trapped by the state.This movie was made during the height of the Cold war, Apartheid, and at a time when the crimes of many governments throughout the world made daily news. It is even more timely in a world where ""enemy combatants"" are held and interrogated in secret prisons, denied legal rights or counsel; where ""ethnic cleansing"" lays waste to whole societies, and humanitarian aid is denied. It demonstrates that the individual can stand up to the state or other oppressor by refusing to give in to fear and terror.",positive,en,2

"I stayed at the Millennium Biltmore for one evening and my overall experience was good. The hotel is beautiful and the staff was very pleasant. The location is within walking distance of most downtown attractions. The reason for the Average rating is because of the room smell, bed, and dust.

"We got two rooms via Priceline for $133 each. The in-laws got theirs for $99 on HotWire. Right next to the Convention Center, walk out onto the Riverwalk. For those that want a cheap breakfast, the Denny's is a block away, a McDonalds more like three.
Paul the valet did a very nice job, very pro and courteous, offered some good intell. The front desk, they started with ""5 nights"". I said ""No, 2"". He said, ""Well, Priceline charged you for five."" I had my receipt from Priceline, which clearly showed two, and showed it to him. He shrugged, and said ""Whatever"", and gave us our keys. Rooms are a nice size. The wife said it was the worst hotel bed she had ever slept on, and she likes soft beds. I was not especially excited either. When you have 1000 rooms, I suppose it gets expensive to replace them. But maybe it's time.
I checked my credit card records online shortly after arriving (on my phone, as I didn't want to pay for their internet), and sure enough, two room charges for five nights, charged by Priceline. I call them, and they recite back to me the original reservation for two nights, and swear that is all they have charged. After going to a second person, that person calls the hotel for a chat, and then tells me to go back down and the hotel would issue new receipts to show the correct amount. She was adamant that this was the hotel's error, not priceline's. I find the correct person at the front desk, and he fixes the charges. He is clearly not happy about it, but he is polite, and is adamant this isn't their fault. OK, whatever. But fair warning.
Other than that, the stay was fine. Yes, charges for everything, like parking and internet. You push the button on the bottom of the switch to turn off the bathroom light when exiting. The concierge sent us off to a fancy Italian trattoria when I asked for a ""pizza joint"", but it actually turned out great. See my review of Tre Trattoria.
I likely would not stay there again, just because I can get a better bed at other places around the Riverwalk at a reasonable price. Though for $100, the Grand Hyatt might be hard to beat.",neutral,en,1

"Went to Ichabods on the insistance of a good friend who wanted to \""hang out\"" there. The first time we went there, we sat at the bar and had a largely pleasant experience. I was surprised at the atmosphere, it was old Vegas and \""antique-y\"" at its finest! They have plush toilet seats, 'nuff said :)\n\nThere was an elegant looking old-time white piano with a pleasant old man singing Sinatra-type tunes and playing jazzy influenced music. Nothing spectacular, but I definitely felt more cultured downing down more beers here, than at any other bars that I frequent. The food was okay. I got clams, expecting the real thing and got fried ones instead--they were super bland and devoid of flavoring yet full of grease--disappointing! Potato wedges were flavorful and just a bit above average. Ceasar salad was good with fresh chicken pieces.\n\nBar atmosphere was fun, but the wait staff and barteneders are all on the elderly side which made the experience a bit uncomfortable at times as whenever I dropped the \""f\"" bomb or my friend smoked her cigarette, quite a few old patrons gave us \""disapproving\"" glances. We thought it was quite funny, actually!!!\n\nThe second time I went there had a different experience. We sat at one of the dining booths, and the food came in a terrible fashion. The waitress kept on messing up orders and the food was average at best. I must say that out of everything that our party of 4 ordered, the only stand-out item were pizza fries which came out just like I remember them from the East Coast--greasy, cheesy and good.\n\nThis night the singer was a young European woman who gave attitude to me when I tried to play the juke box--how dare do I play juke box if here talent is about to play piano?1? (I truely felt bad at first, because I didn't know, but later stopped feeling bad as this pianist gave me attitude and everyone informed me that juke box is not to be played until late night, as owner \""does not want hard rock blazing during other hours\""). Additionally, this woman sucked as a singer, yet tried to sing the most sappy songs out there. Her piano playing skills were okay, but singing killed the mood, as it was that bad.\n\nI did love the juke box and the shuffle board--in fact we'll come here again just to play shuffle-board, but I don't think that I'll eat anything other than the pizza fries and beers, and I'll continue to sit at the bar. Also, I'll make sure the man is playing the piano and not the full-of-herself sucky singer woman.",negative,en,0

"I really want to give this place a better rating, but just cannot. I have been to Rare on three separate occasions and would \""possibly\"" give it another try in the future.\n\nFirst time I went was great. From the friendliness of the service all the way to the last bite of the meal, which brought me back once again.\n\nMy second experience was about 10 minutes long. Took a table in the bar area with the plan to have a cocktail and a light dinner with the lady, and did not even get approached by a server for that 10 minutes. Sorry, but a place of this level the service should be superior, and i've had service be more attentive at Denny's.....\n\nThird and last time iced this place for me. Called and made a reservation for 6 o'clock on a Thursday and showed up to NOT have a reservation, although there were at least 20 tables that were open, and many of those were still open upon my party leaving, we were told to grab a table in the bar area and a server will be with us. Though upset, I kept my cool and we took a seat at a table in the bar area. Over 10 minutes went by again waiting for a server to acknowledge we were even there! The server was fantastic, and clearly was not her fault as she was given the ENTIRE bar area and outdoor seating area to handle by herself, which shows this establishment has management that could learn a thing or two....\n\nBoth times I ate the food was great, the servers I had were excellent, however there is something about this place that makes me feel the overall experience should be at a higher level. Giving Rare some time and I will be back, though they do need to work on providing a higher level of overall service to their patrons. Cheers!",negative,en,0

"We stayed in tower 3. This was a first stop on the way to LA and Vegas. The hotel has a nice lobby, which is always busy. Theres a starbucks inside the hotel, ATMs, a little gift shop, urban tavern restaurant bar, which we didn't go to. There are lots of places you can go to around the hotel. Location is fine but be sure you know where you are going because a few streets downs it starts looking quite seedy. Its also close to Macy's and Westfield Mall. You can also catch the cable car on Powell about 2 blocks from the hotel. The rooms are terribly small. The bathroom is so small you cant really have 2 people in it at the same time. The rooms are clean, beds comfortable and everything is in working order - bathroom taps are a bit difficult to open. The hotel also provides international plugs if you ask. No free wifi !! Really that is such a necessity - when you are paying $ 300 for a room you expect wifi to be free. The staff are very helpful. Oh and if you receive anything at the hotel you must pay $5 for each package. I had 6 packages arrive for me - so no prize for guessing how much i had to pay!!! In this hotel you PAY for everything. The keys also lock you out of the room if you put them near cellphones. No one tells you this and then to get a new key you must show ID, which you might not have so you actually have to go up to the room with security and get the ID then you get a key. Its a good security measure but please warn people about it so we can keep the keys away from cell phones.",neutral,en,1

"I've stayed at this hotel so many times I can't even count. And every time I do I'm not disappointed. It is by far the best hotel in Times Square and probably my favorite place to stay in NYC. I'm surprised that other reviewers would have anything negative to say about this place because I have never had a bad experience here. Everything from the lobby, to the rooms, to the service, to the location is ideal in my opinion.
Firstly, the rooms are about as big as you'll find anywhere in the city. The heavenly beds are incredibly comfortable and despite the fact that the hotel is just about a block away from the center of Times Square, I can't recall ever really noticing the noise from outside. The bathrooms are very clean, modern, and contemporary and I absolutely love the heavenly shower.
The location is also ideal being just a block away from the middle of everything in Times Square but equally conveniently located less than a block from the Port Authority bus terminal and right across the street from the entrance to the Subway. No matter how you come into the city it's easy to get to the Westin via public transportation.
I also happen to love the cocktail bar off of the lobby. They have a great martini menu and also have a light food menu... a perfect place to start an evening. I've also heard really good things about the steak house Shula's (although I'm not a big red meat eater myself).
The concierge has always been very helpful in suggesting places to eat nearby and the front desk staff has also always been very accommodating in allow us to check-in early when rooms are available.
One thing to watch for is when they offer weekend discounted room rates via the Starwood website. Every once and awhile you can get a room here for $199/night-- which is a bargain for the area. I probably wouldn't ever pay over $299 to stay here (or anywhere for that matter) but when I see a great rate pop-up I'm always first to snatch it up.
Overall I can't see one thing to fault in this hotel. Every time I try another hotel in the area I'm reminded of why I love this one so much. I will definitely be coming back again and again.",positive,en,2

"Only stayed overnight for stopover before going to Sedona via Old Town Scottsdale. Had stayed before & reckon the addition of new bar/restaurant since last visit has been well worth it. Staff were very friendly throughout the hotel. Rooms spacious & clean, granted it was the executive floor we stayed on. Only room downside was that we felt it was showing signs of age but this may be a bit picky. Rimrock Bar & Grille, as mentioned above being fairly recent, is a definite plus point. Staff were great, food, although usual fayre, was plentiful & very tasty. We had 2 appetizers which were as big as main courses with the squid especially very tasty.

"We used to frequent Buca di beppo at least once every other month a few years ago, as it was the \""new\"" place to dine for us coming from Olive garden. Back then we thought the pricing was a little high for the amount of food you get. Just went back and realized the prices have gone up about $5 an entree which is family style. But the portion sizes haven't gotten bigger. The stuffed prosciutto chicken is hardly stuffed with anything and it was dry as a bone. I'm beginning to think the prices were raised to sort of offset the $10 coupon that you can get quite frequently. Example of over pricing. $39.99 for large chianti braised short ribs. The are good, but you get 3 small pieces to share with your family. Same goes for all the meat entrees. The pasta, salad and pizza are good and that's what we will stick to.

"We spent a romantic weekend at the Carlyle on recommendation from a friend who raves about their service. Even though we were primed to expect the best, the hotel exceeded our expectations in all categories. The Carlyle is a European-style hotel decorated with a perfect, elegant blend of modern and classic -- everywhere you look it is relaxing and beautiful (and their floral arrangements, including gorgeous live orchids, are from one of the finest florists in Manhattan). Every single member of staff we encountered was not just courteous and helpful, but genuinely friendly, and happy to go above and beyond. We had bad weather our second night and needed to run a quick errand a few blocks away, so we asked them to call us a taxi -- instead, they put us in the hotel's courtesy car. The next day, we were running late for an appointment and needed something picked up about 10 blocks away -- they went and got the item and put it safely in my room. Our waiter pointed out the charming details in the hand-painted wallpaper in the dining area. The elevator attendants and front desk staff remembered our names. These are all just small examples of the seamlessly fabulous service they offer. Our room was superb -- comfortable bed, good water pressure in the shower, spotlessly clean. Room service was excellent. The location was perfect for us as well -- a quieter part of the city right by Central Park. All in all, a dream.",positive,en,2
"I came to Becky for a few reasons, but the main one was to change my life. I was so tired of traditional counselors, and telling them the same old story without improvement. It's tiring when you tell the same story and nothing changes. I found Becky on the Thumbtack website. I had a good feeling about her, especially the fact she was willing to work with my financial needs-this is always a good sign.\nMy first consultation with her- no hypnotherapy- I actually felt better. I felt like finally I was on the right track to handling my past traumas and current situation. She told me she would get me off my anxiety meds in that first counsultation. Lo and behold after only a consultation I felt no neeed to take them anymore.\nI purchased five sessions with Becky after the consultation because I was confident she was able to help me put some of my demons at rest. And she did that and more. I felt comfortable with her because she is a very real, nice, honest and funny person. She made me feel at ease immediately. She validated my feelings and gave me a new perspective on self defeating thoughts and thinking.\nHypnotherapy for me was not being hypnotized and not knowing what the heck I was doing or saying. I was aware, in a guided relaxed state, with positive thoughts entering my mind. My favorite was the last session where I did a bit of past life regression. Becky will not make you go through a negative experience, in fact she takes you out of it almost immediately, unless she has questions about the event.\nThe other thing I love about Becky is that she is always in contact with her patients. She texts and emails which to me is fabulous. Don't be surprised if you get a text out of the blue or an email to find out how you are doing. Even if the sessions are up she still wants to know how you are doing.\nThis is a fabulous woman, teacher and friend. I can't imagine saying anything bad about her. She truly understands and knows what she is doing. I love her and plan to get periodic sessions from her. I also will listen to whatever she tells me to do to help in my self healing process. She is truly such an inspiring person.\n-On another note, if you do not know where your life is going or where you should be, she will tell you.

But Tom Everett Scott, always underrated, was even better. He should be a star. My only complaint is with one aspect of the screenplay. None of the characters ever acknowledged that the dead daughter wasn't always a good person. And neither was her mother, played by Keaton.

"Wow. \n\nThat's really the first word that comes to mind when thinking about a recent trip I was able to make to the Desert Botanical Garden. Part of the lack of significant verbage is that I simply do not know how to describe my experience there! It was definitely like nothing I've seen before. \n\nI went with a friend one night during the holiday season \""Las Noches de las Luminarias\"" and Chihuly in the Garden exhibits. Basically what this broke down to is that the entire park was illuminated by literally thousands of softly glowing, hand lit Luminaria bags and interspersed throughout the park were huge, strangely beautiful glass blown sculptures by this Dale Chihuly artist guy. Now I'm not a big art guy by any stretch of the imagination (my idea of art is someone making a beautiful play on a football and hauling in an admirable reception), but I have to say that walking through these exhibits at night was pretty cool and definitely very unique.\n\nAbove and beyond the artistic ingenuity, there were also carolers, Apache storytellers, live music, and beer and wine stations interspersed throughout the park. Needless to say, it's pretty easy to make a full night out of your trip here.\n\nStaff members were friendly and welcoming and the grounds were impeccably maintained. It's clear that this is a park that knows what it is doing! If I lived in the area, I'd definitely be visiting here during the daytime for its abundant vegetation, wildlife, and views of the desert. \n\nI must admit that $30 per ticket (though it's less if you're a park member) seemed a bit steep, though ultimately it was worth it!",neutral,en,1

"We went to this location, on Cochran Road, a couple nights ago around 10pm. We ordered the wedge salad, an appetizer trio, and the wings (which I ordered extra crispy). The salad came first and was pretty good but seemed to not have any toppings except for the salad dressing. The appetizer trio came out next and was a bit of a disappointment. The potato skins weren't that good- mushy and no seasoning (salt/spice). Also, the bacon was soft and mushy. The nachos were edible but nothing to write home about- again a little mushy once you got below the ones on the top and the guacamole was pretty bland. The buffalo chicken planks were a little under-cooked for my taste but were otherwise good. The buffalo wings came out last and I was happy with them- they were done (crispy) the way I like them. The wings were what I was craving when I walked into the place- the void was filled. \n\nThe service was a little slow. We sat at the bar and there were only 2 other people at the bar and only 1 table with 4 people elsewhere in the place. They seemed to be starting to close up at that time. It took about 10 minutes to get our drinks because the bartender dropped a wine bottle- so we had to wait for him to clean it up and hear his amazing account of the accident before being served. \n\nI would go back again the next time I crave wings (because decent wings are really hard to find in the South Hills). Maybe during the day the service will be faster. I will definitely order the wedge salad again and the wings but will be more careful when ordering the appetizer.",negative,en,0

"Meh, I've experienced better is a perfect sum up of this.\n\nWe waited for about 15 mins to be seated. Had a couple more minutes to wait for drinks. \n\nI ordered the goat cheese, tomato, spinach scramble (I think that's what it was...) BF ordered smoked salmon scramble. \n\nThey got to the table, portions are huge and presented nicely. I started to eat the fruit and was looking for pepper for my eggs when I realized there was ham in mine. Hmmm. Not what I ordered. I ate the fruit and biscuit. Both fine. The potatoes were actually pretty good. Crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. I liked them. No waiter to check on us at this point. I decide to at least try the egg mixture on my plate. Kind of greasy. Just okay. Tried the BF's salmon eggs. Same thing. Just okay. Though he did have the pleasant surprise of a bone in them :/\n\nFinally waiter comes by asking how we are. At this point, I am done eating. I have eaten enough carbs between the potatoes and biscuit that I don't want anything else. But I tell him everything is fine, except what I got was not what I ordered. He looks, \""oh, you are right\"". Yeah, I know that. \""Do you want me to go switch it?\"". Um, no. I have been here 15 mins and have already filled up on other stuff. \""You sure?\"" Yes. \""Was what you did get served good at least?\"" Seriously? Um. It was okay. \""I am sorry about that\"". Yeah okay.\n\nAnother 15 mins we get the check... No relief. Seriously? Then I was annoyed and just wanted to leave... \n\nIt is fine for what it is. Take the reviews to heart here and don't expect greatness. Just large portions and good potatoes.",negative,en,0

"The Renaissance is a nice, modern hotel. We paid $175 on priceline.com for a double room - same room goes for $240 on the hotel's website. We wouldn't have booked without getting a discounted rate. Biggest disappointment with this hotel was that they didn't offer a breakfast nor do they offer free internet/wi-fi access. Overnight parking costs $30, but you can go in and out with room key.
The hotel was located at the North end of Downtown Seattle and not really in walking distance to main sites (unless you want to walk back up steep hills). We took cabs to the market and baseball game, but didn't pay over $10 on a cab ride and the trips didn't take more than 10 minutes.

"Finally decided to give this place a try thanks to the purchase of a groupon which made it a pretty great deal but overall I think the prices are a little high for the environment. It is a really tight space that doesn't feel comfortable or inviting at all. They had it decorated in a cool way but that just barely helped it not to feel like we were in a fast food joint. I think they should reconfigure the space and turn it into an order at the counter style where you just grab some tacos and a bucket of beer an head out to the patio (like America's) or take a lunch to go.\n\nWe both ordered items that I am pretty sure they have on their menu at the Bistro. Hubby got the pasta which was delicious (yes, I stole a bite) and I ordered the shredded pork torta which was also delicious. Sweet potato fries were yummy with good seasoning on them but unfortunately a bunch had gotten stuck together and formed some kind of mass which was a bit unappetizing. I guess that happens but I don't think they should have served them like that.\n\nNot much else to say, our server was great. Really nice guy though of course I have forgotten his name already. I probably wouldn't drive out of my way to come here for dinner again but if I was downtown for some reason I'd probably grab lunch or happy hour here.",negative,en,0

"We stayed for 2 nights at $150 per night. The location is perfect--right outside the door is the cable car; shopping is all around; a few breakfast places are right across the street; and the public parking garage is one block away (TIP--it is MUCH cheaper to park your own car at the Stockton/Sutter garage which is one block away). The hotel charges $38 per day so our two nights would have been $76. Instead, our two night charge was under $45 by self parking and we had freedom to go in and out as we pleased without waiting for our car. Be sure you use the PUBLIC parking garage which is managed by the City and has reasonable rates.
The room -- very clean and surprisingly roomy. The view from the 23rd floor is beautiful. The upper levels are very quiet (we even opened our window at night) and the better view is the ""back"" toward Russian Hill and Coit Tower (which we had). The bedding is very comfortable and the bed itself felt new.
We were there during the strike in early November and I think because of the inconvience of hearing the workers march outside, we received complementary drinks at the bar our first night. By the way, we never heard the picket line in our room but I imagine that the guests on lower levels and in front rooms were affected!
I highly recommend this hotel for its location, value and comfort. Be wary of neighborhoods when booking a downtown SF hotel--a few blocks makes a BIG difference and some areas are very sketchy. This was very safe and an easy walk into Chinatown and even up to North Beach and Fisherman's Wharf (but we able to take the cable car back and it stopped right at the door to the hotel!) We enjoyed having our car there for drives to Marin County and also into some of the residential neighborhoods.",positive,en,2
"We stayed at this hotel for three nights because we got a great price on the rooms. There is a resort fee that is charged above and beyond the room fee. Long check in line but they did serve ice cold bottles of water and offered 5 minute chair massages. Nice touch. Check in time is 3PM (we got to the front desk at 3:15PM). Check out time is 4PM... thus our suite was not ready. We had to sit in the lobby for 30 minutes and wait for our room to be ready. We had to get back on the line to get room keys. The second person who helped us upgraded us to a corner suite. Beautiful room. We met the housekeeper on the way to the room - truly wonderful lady!! Room was neat and clean and HUGE! \n\nThe three young men in the room next to us were causing minor problems (nothing too bad by Vegas standards) but Trump took guest complaints very seriously!!! Two security guards and one manager showed up quickly and the problem folks were removed from the hotel. \n\nNo casino, no real restaurant (few seats in \""living room style\"" atmosphere), no real commotion - nice quiet luxury hotel. We visited the bar once - great signature martini's and nice service. They do provide shuttle service to the Wynn and Ceasars. Right across the street from restaurants and shopping. Room service was pricey but that's a given in Vegas. They do allow dogs! This is a non-smoking hotel.",positive,en,2

"Having read a bad review of a place near Civic Center I have stayed in a couple of times before, I changed at last minute to Comfort Inn by the Bay based on reviews here. The recent reviews are quite accurate: this is a decent place to stay, somewhat convenient to Fisherman's Wharf, a little inconvenient for other locations.
Room was small but fine; loud noise from rain falling on the air conditioner can be forgiven since that day was the heaviest rain on that date since 1838! Room faced a wall, so no view, but hardly ever in it during the day, so that was also no problem. Upgrades available for a fee. Wireless internet handy and free.
Surprisingly, hard to find a late night snack on Lombard, but pretty good snacks in the snack machine on the third floor. Breakfast was quite good, especially the waffles. Was there pretty early every day so can't comment on them possibly running out of things.
From one block north (Chestnut) there is the #30 bus through North Beach and Chinatown to downtown, takes about 20-25 minutes. To come to the hotel, cable car to Lombard, then walk downhill. To make the return trip that way would be a bit brutal since it is quite a hill. As usual, for a stay in the SF city area, a Muni Passport is a good idea, I don't think they have them at the desk though. This is especially true if staying at this hotel since only Fisherman's Wharf west area (Ghirardelli etc.) is really within walking distance.
Staff, as mentioned in other reviews, was quite friendly and helpful and the area is better than many.",negative,en,0

"We recently stayed here from Sunday through Friday. The hotel is an excellent location, in walking distance to many of the local attractions. Our room had a balcony and an excellent view of the bay. There is a nice pool in the hotel. The food from both the bar/restaurant in the hotel and the deli which is also related to the hotel were very good. The shuttle the hotel provides is very nice with a couple drop off time in the morning to various tourist spots and a couple PM pick-ups. The hotel also has an airport shuttle that drops you off or picks you up every 30 minutes from early AM until midnight.
Now let's review the downsides of the hotel. The hotel is definitely dated, our room while clean looked dated, the rug had a few burn spots, the nightstands look like they had severe water damage on the bottom, dried out and reused. The room had a musty smell the first few nights. It also had a very strange layout, with the only closet in the bathroom and the bathroom door was a sliding door which didn't provide much of a separation from the sleeping area. I am a platinum member at the Holiday Inn and asked for the manager to contact me but no one ever did. The other disappointing thing is many of the staff I would consider not helpful, I won't say rude but more like they acted is if they had something more important to do. Mind you this was not the entire staff but I would say more unhelpful then helpful. We also had a bad experience (she was entirely unhelpful) with one of the concierges but the next morning we had Norma (I think was her name) and she was excellent. I'm generally a good tipper to bell staff, shuttle drivers, etc. but this trip I didn't tip at all do to the attitude of those providing service.
Some complained about the noise but I didn't find it an issue as long as the sliding glass door to the balcony was closed. However, if open or when you are on the balcony you can hear the airplanes landing and taking off (airport is 1 mile away), military aircraft (Navy and Coast Guard) and the whistle from the Public Transit Trolley. None of this interfered with our stay at all.
In the end this is a reasonable priced hotel for San Diego, great location and the shuttle is a nice addition, dated with a less than personable staff. My next trip I would likely stay at another hotel.",neutral,en,1
"It was not that busy on a Friday night at 9ish during spring restaurant week, Food was ok. First few bites of calamari app were good but the rest was doused in the sweet glaze that ruined it. Scallops were good but were served with a crispy seaweed side that was terrible and inedible. Server said the dessert was some kind of fried cheesecake but there was a server switch twice during the dinner and the other server brought us some choc cake that was fine. Nothing special. The wine was brought in a nice sturdy tall wine glass but the second glass was brought in a smaller one. Upon tasting it I realized it was the wrong wine. Serving staff was nice but seemed unorganized and unfocused, food was a little disappointing.",negative,en,0
"I would advise anyone visiting NYC to NOT stay at this hotel. List of reasons why:
Hotel is a knockoff of a W hotel. It is like staying in a bad dance club. Front desk, outdoor park, lobby area, hallways are all dark with no lighting. The walls of the hallway are painted black and the carpet is dark with stains and dirt everywhere. Pot and cigarette smoke on one floor...smell of meatloaf on another floor.
The rooms are tiny - even for NYC standards. Can't even sit on the toilet straight because the wall is so close.
Front Desk Staff - unhelpful, unfriendly, not too bright.
No safe in our room, had to change rooms after asking to speak to a manager.
$16 dollar drinks in the bar.
No air conditioning in the lobby, elevators or hallways. Very hot in the summer.
Entrance is on ground floor, lobby is on 2nd floor so you have to go up an escalator to get to the lobby/front desk...which isn't a problem unless you have luggage. You can get to an elevator by going through a roped off area and bell stand.
I got a good rate on hotels.com which was about half the rate on the hotel's website. It still wasn't worth that price!

Change your expectations and you'll enjoy it. Your room will not have a flat screen TV or a big soaking tub. Now, I did notice that it seemed a little dingier than when I'd stayed here several years ago. Maybe they're sinking a lot of money into their \""Go Rooms\"" which from the web site, remind me of rooms at some of the W Hotels I've stayed at. As a bonus, the nice front desk clerk gave us two upgraded rooms instead of the one regular room we though we were getting. Nice!

"A 3 days visit to NYC motivated me to try this hotel, I needed something close to Times Square, this was the Hotel with the best price. I paid well under 100$ a night so I was not expecting much.
The rooms are basic and the heating system is typical turn of the century, if you hear a loud banging, that is the heating system, it only happened a few times per night so it was bearable.
The hotel is pretty run down and beaten but pretty clean. The Reception staff is an odd mixture of passive, shy, a bit rude and one very communicative person.
I asked for my room key by naming the room number but they did not verify my name, I reminded them of this so next time they asked ""Are you Mr. Kuhn?"" Well that was close but not much better so from then on I kept my room key with me although they did not allow this for some reason.
The obvious manager was a well dressed woman and she seemed the only one with any service experience. The others did show some effort but were mostly just doing the minimum possible.
I was happy with everything but if your expecting a hotel experience then lower your expectations more like an apartment with a reception.
All in all very much worth the price!

They actually care about the health and well being of your feet. I realized for the past year I had been going to another salon that was not giving my toes the attention they need! Standard pricing so that once in a while I can treat myself without breaking the bank. \n\nVERY friendly staff.

"My family and I recently stayed at this property for 3 nights in a 2 bedroom suite. It was very nice to have the extra space, and 2nd bathroom. Kitchen and living area were nice. Property itself was average, nothing ""Beverly Hills"" about it. Only one elevator at this property. I was glad to have requested a low floor so we could use the stairs. This hotel does offer a free shuttle within a 3 mile radius. This was very nice to use as cab rates are extremely high. However the shuttle stops at 6:30pm which is early. We didn't take advantage of the daily breakfast, but rather ate across the street at Factor's Famous Deli. The food was good and reasonably priced. Most of the hotel staff were friendly with the exception of one nighttime front desk clerk. He had an attitude and was full of sarcasim. Not what I expect out of people employed to assist other people. We did have an issue our second night with drunk, noisy neighbors. I had to call the front desk twice. Not sure if anything was done about their noise, or if I just finally fell back asleep. I was awakened around 1am with screaming, and what sounded like breaking furniture. I was not happy about that! Hotel is within walking distance of restaurants in Beverly Hills, i.e CPK and Cheesecake Factory. Several local eateries too that looked really nice. Overall, I found it to be a good property.",neutral,en,1

My mom saw Frank Sinatra at a theater about the same time this movie came out. She said they couldn't clear the ""bobby-soxers"" out between movies (in those days you didn't have to leave between showings). This movie shows you how attractive and appealing the young Frank was and allows you to appreciate his early talent as well. And Victor Borge gets in a bit of his routine in, which is a bonus. This is a fun movie with a sweet, simple storyline. Very enjoyable.",positive,en,2

"AVOID USING THIS COMPANY!
Do NOT purchase anything from this company!!! They are a complete joke and waste or time! They are not 'quick or a 'fix'!! I don't think they even have physical phones to sell.
I waited 3 weeks for a refurbished phone I ordered back in April as my own broke - I was originally told 7 - 10 days until I receive it. Chased couple of times when it didn't arrive and was told due to COVID they were short staffed and to be patient. So I gave them the benefit of the doubt and allowed more time.
After the 3 wks I contacted Quick Mobile Fix again only to be told there are problems with phone and I would have to wait another 10 days or so or I could get a refund. Opted for the refund as I was completely phoneless (ordered another phone elsewhere which was super quick), they said refund would take up to 14 days. After the 14 days every week I checked my account and no refund appeared and chased them each time only to still get due to COVID there is a delay in refunding you. Ended up waiting a total of 7 weeks for a refund of over £100. The customer service phone line for them never worked - bit suspicous... Surely if refunds take this long then they shouldn't be open as a business. So the whole process took 10 weeks of my time and unnecessary stress. They do not live up to their name of Quick Mobile Fix!!!",negative,en,0

"While on a Business trip to Pittsburgh I got to mark off my 4th Hot Dog restaurant that was featured on the PBS \""A Hot Dog Show\"" \n( The previous 3 = Skin Thrasher's - Anderson, SC, Pinks, LA,Ca, American Coney Island.).\n\n Lets just say that Pinks has nothing to worry about being Dethroned from #1 in my world. I went in on a Wednesday around 11am'ish and there was maybe 5 other people in the place already eating and I was the only one at the ordering counter and ordered the All Beef wt onion, Chili & cheese and paid -$5.96, and at a separate counter ordered a Small order of fries wt Cheese Sauce on the side paying again -$5.92 for a Total of $11.88. Its a weird set up they have going paying at each counter but I guess there is a method to their madness and whatever works for them.\n\nThe Hot Dog did have a snap to it as advertised but it was overall just another Hot Dog and nothing special. The French fries did live up to its \""as advertized\"" HUGE portion but over all I wasnt impressed with them considering some of the reviewers here saying they were the \""Best they have ever had\"". The fries didnt even come close to the fries we made getting out of school in the 9th Grade and going over to my neighbors house and making fries in the \""Fry Daddy\"" (Remember THAT sweet appliance?) We use to make them thick Steak House cut, Medium & thin cut and damn we had that shit down!! Now those were the BEST fries I have ever had.\n\nSo overall I say: Over priced & over rated Nationally.

I stayed on the 7th floor and had a great view of the Hancock building from my room.
The Positives: The staff was great. The girl at check-in was fantastic and gave me advice on where to go (and not) while also helping me to find a place that wasn't $50+/night to park. This is a fantastic location.
The Negatives: They had some weird blinds on the windows to prevent bugs from coming in. I think they're probably better to just permanently lock the windows and get rid of them.

"Stayed in town for the baseball games and fireworks and decided to splurge and try something different. Games were awesome and fireworks even better! The positive aspect of our RC experience included an outstanding parking and front door staff. They gave us the impression that they're concern was for us and that they would truly attempt to make our stay enjoyable. After making it to our room we discovered that spending nearly $600 doesn't go as far as it used to. The shower smelled moldy and wouldn't drain very well. The fan/ventilation would, on nearly perfect 5 minute intervals, noisily ramp-up and then obnoxiously shut down. I reported these issues and while the shower situation was alleviated the fan stayed true to form until we checked out. For our first nights turn down service we were presented with four diminutive chocolate candies and two water bottles already opened. Thats right, the caps seal was broken. It should also be noted that one of the bottles wasn't completely full. We recommend forgoing the service, buying your own candy bar and pulling back the covers on your own. One more thing, for the aforementioned outlay you would think that WiFi would be complementary. Guess again.

"My first Aloft experience was unfortunately a disaster and was very disappointed in being a big Starwood fan.
First problem -- they need to change the address of the hotel. The entrance to the hotel is near the corner of 4th and S. College St. The listed address is for the entire EpiCentre which is composed of shops and restaurants.
Second problem -- made the mistake of self-parking in the EpiCentre garage ($20/day) that was designed incorrectly according to the engineer on site. They forgot to install an elevator on the lower parking levels. And there's no direct elevator from the garage to the hotel lobby. My advice is to valet should you stay here.
Third problem -- once I found the elevators off of College St. they were broken and unable to take them to the 5th floor where the lobby of the hotel is located.
Fourth problem -- If your room faces down on the EpicCentre be prepared to hear loud music playing till 2 AM. If you want to sleep you'll need earplugs even if you're on the 15th floor.

"This is fairly typical for the Sci-Fi Channel: one-dimensional characters, a ridiculous plot, and terrible special effects. We've got some alien sock puppets loose on a train, and Lou Diamond Phillips does his best with what little he's given to eke out a performance. And save the day. Everyone else in this is utterly dispensable; the ex-wife who goes through the time-honored cliché of first disliking Lou, then of course comes to love him again at the end. The obnoxious State Senator who gets munched early on, and a gaggle of dull security guards who run around a lot. Then there's an eco-terrorist who is in this movie for absolutely no reason whatsoever, except to provide us with 3% more running around. He spends the whole middle part of the movie hiding in a box.The special effects really deserve their own paragraph. We start with a meteorite that flies through the air, trailing flames behind it, at about 100 miles per hour. According to the physics of this movie, if you exceed the posted speed limit in your car, atmospheric friction may cause you to burst into flames. Then it lands on the hood of a car, coming in horizontally. Sort of like a velcro ball landing on a velcro floor I guess. It really doesn't damage the car much, just bends up the hood a little bit. Later on Lou gets in a helicopter and goes chasing after the train. Even though the train only had a two minute head start, it takes a good half hour to catch it. The CGI is so bad that the helicopter looks like it's as big as the hills it's flying over. Then it flies into the side of a mountain - this effect must be seen to be believed. It looks like they took a jar of gasoline and threw it against a wall, then superimposed the flame effect over the helicopter. About 10 times too big. No wonder the helicopter couldn't pull up in time, it was carrying five tons of nitro glycerine. Then the eco-terrorist eventually blows himself up, but instead of exploding in all directions like most explosions do, he explodes upwards like a cannon aimed into the air. Then there's the whole deal with not being able to stop the train because that would allow the little aliens to get off, but it appears that the aliens can actually fly faster than the train is traveling, so why this would keep them on the train I have no idea.Overall, if you've got a couple of hours that absolutely need killing, and it's down to this movie or reruns on the Food Network, well, come to think of it, some of those chefs are kind of cute. Usually these movies have at least one or two things about them that make it possible to sit through them; maybe there's a sexy girl, some T&A, or a character that actually has some personality, or some suspense or, well, something. I really didn't see any of that here.",negative,en,0

Finally I went to the other side of the cash register and placed my item down. The attendant kept chatting it up and scanning my item at the same time. I stated that I wanted $30 of gas on pump #3.

When the place started serving the crab legs, the line became very long. They had pasta and pizza here also, which my friend loved. I skipped that section because it's heavy food. I tasted almost every section. The dessert section was delish. My friends and I shared our desserts because they're so concentrated and fatty; we just wanted a bite of everything.

I can't really say much about the other desserts like bake stuff and chocolate items because I'm not a fan of them in general.\nOverall, I'd totally come back to this place in the future. If you want your money's worth. Try to come during lunch time right before they start serving dinner so you can pay for lunch pricing!",neutral,en,1

"Well, how to start? I saw The Italian Job for the first time some years ago and visiting a rental shop I couldn't quite remember why I had a bad feeling about it. Now I do.After voting for the ratings for this film I saw the statistics. Apparently this film appeals most to under 18 girls. No wonder. They didn't pay enough to Charlize to flash and I guess some girls magazine has rated Mark Wahlbergs abs ""AWESOME"".Other than that this film is completely predictable, the actors are mainly forever B-stars and even the good ones are being misused horribly, the film is filled with obvious product placement and imagine this: it even manages to repeat itself without doing a sequel! The first 15 minutes are the best part of the film and it's all downhill from there and once they figured this out they decided to use the finest hour again in the end repeating-to-detail their gold heist. All in all, lots of noise about nothing.I think Charlize Theron is good and Ed Norton could be more as he's been before. Apart from Donald Sutherland's ""look, I'm here too"" appearing in the beginning I'd say this movie ought to have a ""pass if you're above 18"" all over it.",negative,en,0

"Legume is one of the nicest restaurants in Oakland, but it's obvious they're aware of that fact when setting the prices. The food is good, but not so amazing that one couldn't find a better meal for less money in another neighborhood.

I recently stayed at the Harbor Court for one night during a business trip to SF. The location of the hotel is great... across the street from the Ferry Building with a really nice view of the bay bridge and walking distance to a BART station. The staff was friendly enough and checked me into my room early with no problems. The one thing I noticed almost immediately was that the hotel lobby area seemed a little run-down and stuffy. The room itself was very small (which is OK for a SF hotel) but also stuffy. It was clean for the most part but again seemed pretty run-down. There was an attempt to give it a little bit of the Kimpton style but it definitely fell short - and didn't seem at all to be the caliber of other Kimpton hotels around the country.,neutral,en,1

"I love the old church that houses Taco Guild. It's such a pretty, unique dining experience that if nothing else, try this place out to enjoy the ambiance. Luckily, the food delivers, so you aren't just enjoying eye candy at Taco Guild.\n\nI like that the tortilla chips are warm when they're served, and the accompanying salsa is fresh and delicious. My husband and I started with the Guild Duo - guacamole and queso. The queso was great, with fresh tomatoes and cilantro. The guacamole was good, though a little lightly seasoned for my personal taste. The portion size was big, though, so I can't complain too much.\n\nWe tried the guild chicken taco, vegetable taco, and molida lamb taco. The chicken was really nice, with a touch of sweetness. I could see this becoming my favorite go to taco at Taco Guild. The veggie was great, with wonderfully seasoned vegetables. The molida lamb was rich and delicious. Make sure you like blue cheese before ordering this, and I would suggest only ordering one because it's rich and heavy. The lamb was moist and wonderful - really liked this taco. We also had the beer battered onion jalapeno straws, which were your standard fried goodness, but nothing spectacular to write home about. I think I'll try the corn next time.\n\nI think the prices were pretty reasonable, and the service was good. Parking was easier than I thought it would be.

"Okay, first of all if you are on this site and thinking of booking a hotel, make certain that you print your confirmation because i did and sure enough when we got to the hotel to check in they did not have us booked. They booked me a room anyway but when i got home i had been charged twice. Once by this site and once by the hotel.
The hotel apeears a nice place to visit with a young family upon arrival. The room was of adequate size. The water park was probably the best part of the resort followed by the arcade. Service was just okay.
Having said all that, the major downfall of this place is that it's dirty. The carpet throughout the corridors is in need of replacing or a seroius shampoo at the very least. Rooms as well. There are stains and they are poorly vacuumed. The water park is no exception with bandaids all about the place. Elevator walls are dirty, Bathrooms look trashy with poor workmanship in repairs.( Silicone blobbed aroud the sink and counter and such.) The bed was actually comfortable and appeared clean. which sort of saved the trip. That and the fact that the place was dead and we had the water park and arcade practically to ourselves. The water was warm too!
We ate breakfast at the restaurant there. It was good and the waiter was very friendly. There was no continental or free breakfast of any kind. We asked the receptionist about breakfast our first night there and she said there would be a buffet-style breakfast in the restaurant but there wasn't. Apparently there were not enough people staying there which is strange since they claimed that they were almost fully booked and that ours was the last room available.
All in all they just really need to work on cleanliness and communication. Despite all the positive things, no one wants to stay in or revisit a dirty hotel. EW!",negative,en,0

"We booked this hotel online thru Expedia to get a better rate. We booked three rooms for three nights, asking for twins. Well, two of the rooms had king beds which they would not change, apparently booking through Expedia gets you a ""room"" not the one you actually book. They were extremely unhelpful with this. Not a single apology or any kind of help to rectify our situation. The room itself is dire. I have stayed in some dumps, but at least they were cheap - this place has blood on walls, ripped wall paper, filthy stains eminating from the air conditioning vent. The elevator was hit or miss, I took the stairs as much as I took the elevator. The carpet was hideous, it seriously needs a good cleaning - I wouldn't walk around barefoot. In addition, our phone didn't work consistently, it managed to get through about 50% of the time. I think that the location of this hotel is ideal (right around the corner from Filene's and the Cheesecake Factory) and now that Starwood has taken it on I would hope that they would put some money into cleaning it.

"What a nice surprise was our six night stay at this property! Top notch customer service. Well maintained facility with everything, from pool to exercise room to laundry, in working order. Clean (and recently updated we think) studio suites with comfortable beds and good bathroom layouts.
Setting expectations appropriately for what a Springhill Suite property is and is not, we’d enthusiastically recommend this one to travelers who were looking for lower end, studio suite Marriott property for either an overnight or extended stay.
We typically do not choose Springhill Suites, as they are lower end for amenities for our preferences. But this one was in a convenient location for us and it required a very reasonable number of Marriott points for the six night stay so we decided why not give it a shot for a multi day visit to Austin.
We’ve stayed at swanky resorts and luxury hotels that would be proud to have the kind of service commitment and ownership of customer care that the staff demonstrated at this Springhill Suites. We imagine that’s because management is paying attention and fostering that culture. So good for them all around!
Springhill Suites as brand still won’t be our first choice for amenity level, but we feel we got more than we paid for at this property, all things considered. A very good value and we're pleased to recommend it.
Summary above, details follow.
TOP NOTCH SERVICE: Our good service experience started at check in. We had requested an upper floor (this is a four floor hotel) with a pond outlook based on other traveler recommendations. And when we arrived, we found that very kind of room had been assigned. Well done.
However, when we got to the room we realized the southern exposure of the front of the building that overlooked the pond was going to provide more heat in the room than we prefer. We also found the room was substantially smaller than we’d be comfortable in for an extended stay. So we asked for a room on the back of the hotel, noisier but cooler, and asked if there was anything larger too.
While we normally avoid rooms next to elevators or ice machines, on this property those rooms are bigger than some of the others, and with the help of the delightful young woman at the desk on our arrival (Fay) we ended up with a room next to an ice machine that was just right for size, location and quiet, even as she had to make a personal visit to a couple of rooms to narrow down the one that would work best for us.
That kind of service focus continued with the “how are you…how was your day…how can I help you..” greetings at the desk from all extended throughout the visit. Up to the day we left when the staff on duty thanked us, sincerely it seemed, for choosing their Springhill Suites and saying they hoped we’d come back. Good training and performance both.
EXERCISE ROOM and POOL: Both adequate in size and well maintained.
LAUNDRY: Well maintained, a couple of washers and dryers in good working order.
FREE BREAKFAST: We’re happy with fresh fruit and yogurt and those were provided here, but also unexpected other healthy options, like raw walnuts and peanut butter. There was the standard plethora of proceessed American breakfast food, but we noted miso soup and steamed rice as daily breakfast offerings along with kimchee noodles.
BATHROOMS: Well laid out for size given the low end nature of Springhill Suites, with extra towels provided. Grab bar in the shower gets a big “woohoo” from us as safety feature.
ROOM: Beds were comfy, suite furniture laid out for easy convenience, fridge and kitchenette sink came in handy.
WIFI: Free and worked well.
PARKING: Ample free parking in lot.
LOCATION: Minutes to downtown Austin and convenient freeway access to travel to points west that we wanted to visit as well.
ACCESSIBILITY: Although we did not look at the accessible rooms on prem, we noted there did seem to be some assigned even on upper floors. (There’s a “woohoo” for you when it is so often the case that these rooms get assigned to the worst spots on the first floor.) In addition, all public areas of the hotel seemed nicely accessible as we looked about.",positive,en,2

"I stayed at this hotel for 33 days during a business trip to San Diego and found it to be a comfortable and enjoyable stay.
The location. The hotel is located in the Hill Crest area of San Diego. There are a lot of shops and restaurants in the area and it is only 1 mile or so from the Gas Lamp district. There is a bus stop close by so you can take the bus to the Gas Lamp district with ease. Hill Crest is known as the ""gay area"" of San Diego and the reason is obvious during the evenings. If this fact somehow bothers you, be advised. Finally, the hotel is located right next to a major hospital. Throughout the day you will hear ambulances racing to the hospital. In my opinion, it was not that big of a deal, but I did hear a few guests complain about the noise. I would suggest asking for a room away from the hospital.
The hotel. I would not call the hotel modern; its years are starting to show. However, it was adequately furnished and clean. I was here for a long period and it was nice that the room had a kitchen and all the necessary dishes, pots, glasses, etc. There was a breakfast every morning in the continental style. It wasn't massive, but it was good. Finally, the parking was free, abundant, and convenient.
In short, this is a good place to stay if you are trying to manage a central location with a budget.",positive,en,2

We got into our room and of course the fireplace didn't work, during our stay we called down 4 times but the fireplace was never fixed. The room was very small but clean. Our room was a non-smoking room but for some reason every few hours the smell of cigarette smoke filled our room. The hallways are dirty and roomservice trays were outside many of the doors. If you aren’t going to spend the extra money to have the ocean view don’t bother staying here, there are plenty of nicer and cheaper hotels around the same area. The parking was ridiculous. It was $30 per day it would have been cheaper to park in a garage since most are $7 on the weekends.

"I recently visited a store in a Currys in New Malden. I was looking to buy a Pixel 3a and had to wait for ages before I was served. The assistant was uninterested in anything apart from selling me insurance and was then unable to print off a receipt dur to 'technical issues'
I agreed to have the receipt emailed to me but it has not arrived. I have tried to phone both the Carphone warehouse and Currys at New Malden but both times after waiting for 5 minutes and them telling me my call was important they cut the call and told me to phone back.
This was unusual for me to visit a store rather than buy online. After having this type of service I will not shop there again and I recommend that unless you need it today and are willing for to put with bad service no one else does either.
I will have to travel to the store again to get a receipt for my purchase as they do not pick up the phone!",negative,en,0

"Parker has been sweet on Celia for years; everyone, including Celia, knows this. The problem is that he seems to be a little too sweet for Celia. She wants a man who will take charge and excite her. So when Parker asks her to marry him, she turns him down flat.Parker is stunned and decides to finally stop playing nice and take what he wants. So he plans for a day when most of her family is out of town and kidnaps her right off her front porch and rides off with her ""into the sunset"". Celia is angered and stunned. But when it becomes clear what he plans to do with her, she is also aroused. Will she finally agree to be his bride?Ms. Wildes sets the pace of this wild and hot story right from the weather to the characters.

"This particular motel, is less than desirable for most folks, in my humble opinion. Though the property looks ok, and does have a nice pool area, there are other problems. The most important, is location. There are a LOT of bums and ""ladies of the night"" lately, and though the establishment provides a security guard, why would you stay at a place that requires one? More times than none, when you go from your room to your car, or to a nearby fast food place, you will be approached by questionable people, such as a street bum or local con-artist. The fact of the matter is, there are a lot of truckers in the area, and people needing money seem to gravitate to the area as well. The rooms do NOT have the usual amenities, such as shampoo, coffee maker, microwave, or clock radio, but they do have a 19"" TV. The rooms also have minor broken or aged fixtures, walls, and fittings.

"I used to go to Sports Clips in OC before I moved to Las Vegas and loved it. I tried a few other places since the move but none thrilled me enough to give them second chances until I found this place. I've been to this Sports Clips location several times now and my experiences there have been fantastic. I (stupidly) cheated on my girl Wendy when a couple friends of mine recommended a barber shop they go to. I tried this barber and it was my worst hair mistake in ten years. As soon as my hair grew long enough to fix, I returned to Wendy at Sports Clips. We laughed about my horror story and she joked that that's why you don't cheat! She's a hair magician. We've done a few different looks on me but every one of them has looked like a million dollars.\n\nI always recommend this location to everyone in need of a great, inexpensive cut. Besides getting a slick haircut at an affordable price tho, a HUGE reason I return here is the customer service. Everyone is professional, friendly, clean, and eager to please. I LIVE on quality guest service (even tho I personally think I'm too forgiving of business' shortcomings), but this location truly delivers QUALITY service. And if you disagree, you must be an idiot. :*\n\nDefinitely returning, NOT ever cheating on Wendy or Sports Clips again, and still referring people to THIS location. :)))",positive,en,2

I will say I did need my ring rushed.. like 2 weeks out from the wedding, it was no problem and I wasn't even charged a rushing fee. I asked for the band to mirror the band on my engagement ring, thin, with channel set diamonds and a European setting (where the bottom is squared off). It was less than the price of my engagement ring (purchased without the center diamond). I was pleased with the work. \nThe only thing I wasnt happy with is the fact that due to my engagement band curving I wasn't told there would be a small gap until I went in to pick it up (3 days before the wedding).

It was immaculately clean....never saw a single ""bug"" or ""stain"", and we are both a bit OCD when it comes to cleaning. The staff was VERY nice. The rooms were beautiful, and obviously recently decorated. That mattress was amazing...no wonder Hyatt beds are legendary! We had a great view of the city, and the location in the West End was ideal. We noticed many people walking. The lobby is connected to the Reunion Tower where the Wolfgang Puck Five Sixty restaurant is. We walked over there Saturday night, sat in the lounge with a drink and watched the city from the revolving restaurant 50 stories up. Lovely! My boyfriend got a terrific price, and this hotel ended up costing him around $240 for a 2 night/3 day stay, and that includes 3 days of valet parking (yeah, you DO have to pay to park, and it's $20 per day. However, the valet service was terrific. We never waited longer than 3-4 minutes to get our car.) The only two bad things? First, the hotel is right next to the train station. It's a little noisy. Not overwhelming, but the trains do run all day and night. Second, the pool...it is TINY, especially for such a huge hotel, and it really needs to be updated.

The restaurant (Ozumo) attached is excellent, and two doors down is Perry's, with many more great choices nearby. One sour note: We were there Xmas day, and there were no pastries available that morning except through the rather expensive room service continental breakfast ($15/person). Also, we found out after the fact that there was a list of dining options for that evening at the front desk which the weekend/holiday staff did not want to share - we got a shrug and a, ""Just go to North Beach and walk around - you'll find something open.""

The room itself was smaller than you would get for the same price in other cities (but then it is NY!) but was nicely furnished and had adequate closet space and all the amenities required for a comfortable stay.

Yes I knew beforehand about the cost of parking downtown so I expected to pay the designated amount. What I didn't expect was to get charged twice for parking. Because of their poor account records and their suspicious staff I paid an excessive price for parking. I was doing an all cash vacation so that's how I paid for parking with the assurance that my credit card wouldn't be charged. Obviously that turned out to be a lie and the hotel or their employee with some sticky fingers pocketed an extra $64 from me.

The eggs benedict didn't fare as well since it was covered with a weird cheesy hollandaise and the egg was well done and the english muffin was dried up. They also have stations for ham, french toast and omelettes. Their dessert station at breakfast almost seemed better than at dinner. My boyfriend appreciated that they offered ice cream at breakfast time. \n\nI wish I had as many nice things to say about the $17.99 dinner buffet. Now that's a pretty good price considering the many $25+ places on the strip. Unfortunately the only standout for me that night was the prime rib. Everything else was average buffet fare. The nacho cheese was congealed and the sword fish was dry. They do have quite a few choices including stations for pasta and mongolian stir fry. The dessert selection is very disappointing - pretty much only slices of cake or pie. However, they do make mini ice cream shakes for you which I thought was cool.\n\nI would come back if I stay at Green Valley Ranch again, but I wouldn't go out of my way to come here. I thought this place was better when I came here a few years ago. Who knows maybe I've just gotten older and out grown the joys of all you can eat...god forbid!",negative,en,0
"This movie is about a young girl who goes to live with her rich cousins falls in love with one of her cousin, and reject the advance of a amoral suitor who brings trouble on the family. After seeing the 1999 version and reading the book, I decided to watch the older version. I found it did stay true to Fanny character in the book, but it was also boring character. Fanny character played by Sylvestra Le Touzel was lackluster; she often appeared to be about to faint. I also did not like Robert Bourbage who played Henry Crawford. I could not imagine him being interested in Fanny or her cousin Maria. Jackie Smith Wood who played Mary Crawford was okay but the wig she wore was so ugly. I lost interested in her acting and I kept staring at her wig. I kept expecting it would drop off her head. I could also see a slip of her real hair under the wig.",negative,en,0

Many thanks to the whole crew, and set for giving us the Darkman trilogy. By the way if your wondering how I came across this one on DVD. I purchased it through the internet, it is however region 4, as you know most US DVD players are region 1.

"The room was ok, clean, good quality of the sheets. The hotel has a van service, that has many restrictions to drive you where you want to go. For example, forget going to Galleria with this service. The taxi charge you 20 USD for going to this mall.
I asked for a late check you, almost begging them. It was Friday afternoon, and not too occupancy. Any way they gave me until 2 pm, and unfortunately I arrived late to the hotel for the check out, at 3 pm. They charged me half day for that hour of difference. Very little flexibility from my point of view.
Food was ok, I had lunch twice there. I ordered breakfast for one to my room (coffed, 1 bagel , plate of fruit) total 33 USD. Very expensible, they told me that the reason was that I said plate of fruit instead of bowl of fruit when I called to the room service.",neutral,en,1

"We knew we had stumbled upon something special when the place was packed full of Japanese-speaking locals within half an hour of opening. They specialize in Hokkaido-style miso ramen.

It comes with a single piece of chashu which is better than most, but for a nicer treat, order the premium chashu. For an extra dollar you can get a large bowl, or two dollars for super-size. Extra toppings such as negi, nori, and menma are available for an additional cost. Prices are reasonable as long as you don't go overboard with extra toppings. Service is decent with a nice ambiance to match. \n\nWhile not quite as tasty as our fave, tonkotsu ramen, this is the current top ramen spot in town hands-down.

"Stopped in here during a business trip based on a recommendation from a local. \n\nThe ambiance is neat. I really enjoyed that you can see the kitchen because of its open design. \n\nThe menu had some interesting items on it. I ordered the Korean Style Shortrib Cap. The flavor in the initial bite was quite delicious. It didn't last throughout the entire plate, however. \n\nThe portion size was OK for a later evening meal. However, if I were eating Dinner at a normal time of night, I would probably have been hungry a few hours later.

The rooms are badly in need of renovation and the cleaners although pleasant are careless. On returning to my room one day my mobile phone was missing from the charger.

This lamp is not at all orange- despite what the picture shows, it shines bright white. It's not the shape pictured in the listing, as you can see. Also, there is no dimmer switch, or any switch at all, for that matter. All that came in the box was the lamp, a glass dish to set in the top, a leaky bottle of lavender oil, and a USB converter, so you can either plug it into a USB socket or a two pronged outlet. The wood base is nice, but has an over-sized piece of vinyl glued to it, so it doesn't ""hide"" under the wood. I turned it on for about three hours, and it didn’t get hot enough to make the oil drops I put in the cup disperse. Very disappointed.

"Major problems with this stay.
1. Booked a room with a couch but no couch in the room I was given.
2. Bathroom door falling off the hinges
3. Outside door would not stay closed
4. Housekeeping vacuuming the halls at 9:45pm,
5. Extreme noise coming from the bar all night on Friday & Saturday.
6. Loud party in the parking lot going on Friday night starting at 10:45pm I started calling the desk to complain about the noise outside my room and the desk did nothing. After 10 phone calls from 10:45pm to 1:50am I finally told the desk I was calling the police and the General Manager at home then they finally did something about the noise.
Outside door not staying closed was a security issue and the bathroom door off the hinges should have made this an out of order room not a $100.00 a night room. We should have been warned about the noise issues in advance (when reservation was made).
We traveled on business (out of the room from 7am to 10:30pm) and with an infant so no sleep was had in this room over the weekend
I made all of these complaints to the Assist. Front desk mgr. and she did nothing about it. I called the General Manager several times and left messages with no response at all.

"Granted, the crack smoking, the (loud!) prostitute propositioning (at all hours of the night) and the pile of human feces on the streets just outside are beyond the hotel’s control, but this place falls well short of expectations. Its namesake would be embarrassed, no doubt far from impressed (get it?).
For someone who’s rather lax when booking a place to stay to get riled up enough to actually complain publicly is testament to the overall crappiness of my experience here. Don’t be fooled by the overblown star ratings or promises of a “bargain”. If inquiring, be sure to ask about their parking accommodations-- $23 a day for an off site lot located a short but extremely shady 3 blocks away, or the $31 a day “valet” service. Apparently payment for the latter carries with it the right to be berated by the bell captain for not being considerate enough to call 20 minutes ahead of time when wanting to use your car. I waited one night for more than 30 minutes before mine showed up. Then, I had to have it back less than two hours later because the lot were it was going to be kept would close. Worst service ever, and I had to pay for it!

The bathrooms have a luxurious feel to them, and I love the fluffy white towels.\n\nWalking around the hotel is really fun, as they have attempted to re-create Venice with the river running through the central concourse and the gondolas and the gondoliers with their jaunty black hats. There is always some sort of entertainment going on, and there is always something to do for entertainment.\n\nI highly recommend this hotel. But again, if you hate the smell of smoke and want to avoid casinos, you have to walk through the casino to get to all of the hotel rooms. Also, I can't forget to mention the beautiful pool.

"Let me begin by saying that I rated our overall experience Above Average because some of the past reviews had me thinking that I was walking into a unclean hotel.
Normally we stay in the River North Area but unfortuantely most of the decent hotels in that area were booked. So, we decided to book at the Essex and were very hesitant about it at first because it was an unfamiliar place and the reviews were not favorable. I was pretty much expecting the worse.
Here are the positives about our stay...
1)checked in at 11:30 a.m. with no problem
2)free shuttle to the Pier (every hour)
3) free shuttle pick - up from the Hancock
4) immediate action concerning the fresh stains on our room carpet (great job housekeeping and the manager on duty!!!)
6) location (across the street from Grant Park = Buckingham Fountain
7) Savoy Bar and Grill (wide variety of items)
8) valet parking
9) 4th floor heated swimming pool and deck area (pool had to be about 75 degrees)
The negatives......
1)Valet parking (I cringed at paying 29.00 a day, we normally stay at a hotel that offers free parking to its guests)
2) room seemed too small for 2 adults and 3 young kids (we had 2 double beds)
3)location (other than grant park there wasn't much else in the area that we really wanted to see)
4) Savoy Bar and Grill prices were too high
5) rate I paid of 270.14 total
Overall, we were satisfied with our stay at the Essex. Even though we weren't in a familiar area the Essex made it easy for us to get to our main destination (which was the pier). We were able to take the shuttle to the pier, then walk to the Hancock and then be picked up and taken back to the hotel. The kids enjoyed the pool and sitting outside on the terrace. I guess I just kind of wonder what the other posters expected. I by no means expected to be pampered but we were pleased with the hotel and with the customer service given by all staff and the immediate attention they gave to our problem.
Would I stay at the Essex Inn again? Yes
Would I recommend it to others? Yes
Would I pay the same rate? No

"Dr. Marnie Bannister (Magda Konopka) is a horribly disfigured woman. When one of her colleagues discovers a rejuvenation formula, Marnie sees it as her opportunity to become beautiful. When she's denied the drug because of possible side effects, she kills her colleague to get what she wants. The drug works and she becomes beautiful. But the formula brings out the worst in her and it's not long before she's left a string of bodies behind her.Have you ever heard the expression ""as exciting as watching paint dry""? That pretty much sums up Satanik. During the film, one of the characters utters the line, ""Something so horrible, it's inconceivable."" I wasn't sure if he was talking about something in movie or the movie itself. I'm really disappointed because I had high hopes for this one. Satanik had possibilities, but they're never realized. At every opportunity, the plot has Marnie do the dullest things imaginable. The writing is horrible. And part of the problem is Magda Konopka. She's not that appealing and cannot carry the film on her own.Another big problem with Satanik is the direction and editing. It's a mess. We see things and places that have no bearing on anything in the movie. The camera lingers on shots too long after the scene is over. I can't think of a single shot that would call anything but unoriginal. This group of filmmakers exhibits little in the way of imagination or talent.I may not be familiar with the Italian comic on which Satanik is supposedly based, but I'm sure it's got to be better than this.",negative,en,0
"I hate paying more than I need to and was delighted with the Hotel Newton. It was basic and small but my mom and I were very pleasantly housed for our three night stay. Mom was worried because she doesn't do stairs and thinking of leaving the room in the night for the shared bathroom made her apprenhensive. No problem with either though; the elevator was fine and the bathroom was one door away and obviously well kept. Strangely, sharing the bath gave the Newton a homelike aura. It was painless as well because we never noticed sharing. All in all, the neat old hotel had a distinctly lost-in-time feel.

"Need to know:\n1) This is an all day tour, do not book anything else on this day, especially a show!\n2) Breakfast and lunch are provided\n3) Runs about $155 per person\n4) Unlimited bottled water is provide but restroom stops are limited and sometimes questionable \n5) Day will start at about 6:30am and end at about 9:30pm\n\nThe Ride: Yes, the ride up to the GC is extremely long, about 5 hours each way (but what else were you expecting, if you want a short ride take a helicopter tour), with limited restroom breaks and unlimited cold bottled water...probably not the best time for your how much free water can I drink challenge...\n\nThe Stops: You'll make 4 stops on your way to the GC but only 1 on the way back. The first stop is basically an \""order anything you want\"" at McDonalds stops. The second stop is at the newly constructed Hover Dam bypass bridge where you are able to get a great look at the Dam and some awesome photo ops! Third was a fuel stop in Kingman, AZ where you can get some snacks and another opportunity for a potty break (be warned bathroom stop in the morning and bathroom stop in the evening here are two totally different things, yuck!), this will also be your one and only stop on the way back to Vegas from the GC so make it count. And the last stop before hitting up the GC was Seligman, AZ (inspiration for the Disney movie Cars) on historic Route 66.\n\nOur Guide: Our guide, Chad, was great! He was very personable and tried to get everyone comfortable with each other right from the get go. On our way up to the GC he incorporated the perfect mix of Vegas culture, scenic information, and personal stories to share, but also the right amount of comfortable silence for the ride. He made sure we knew what our next stop was and more importantly, for the ladies, where the best bathrooms were. He always offered to take pictures of us and even posed us on and in front of some beautiful scenary (our own personal photographer for the trip, how awesome). I dont know if you can request a certain tour guide, but we were super lucky to end up with Chad! Chad, if youre reading this, thanks for making it an awesome experience!\n\nThe Finale: Although the ride up was long and the restrooms were questionable the views that you get far make up for it! I believe we made 4 stops on our tour that day. The first is for a provided picnic lunch at a nice little spot with about 2 or 3 picnic tables. The second stop was at a lookout point (forgive my forgetfulness with the names) where you can really get a beautifully unobstructed view of the canyon. Here is where you take a short quarter mile walk along the rim of the canyon. Absolutely beautiful! The third stop was another restroom break where you can also visit a store with a gift shop for all your touristing needs :), then it was off to the finale of finales, our sunset spot. The sunset over the GC was beautiful and unlike anything you will ever experience. You don't truly realize how small you are and how big the world around you is until you get to experience something like this. \n\nThe Verdict: Although this was an extremely long day, it was well worth it! Would I do it again, maybe, maybe not, would I recommend this tour to others, absolutely! Even though you can find tours for a lot cheaper, I can guarantee your experience will not be the same! Thank you Chad and Grand Adventures for making my first trip to the GC an amazingly memorable one!\n\nKeeping things short and sweet for me is difficult so you can find a more detailed review with pictures on my blog :)",positive,en,2

The burgers are greasy and awesome, and the cooks will gladly dress them up however you like 'em. Since I moved to Charlotte, I have discovered that I really like chili on my burgers and their chili combined with warm cheese sauce is really the best. It will drip down your chin and hands and you won't want to let a drop go to waste. The onion rings are great, and you can get a combo of rings and fries (called \""frings\"") if you are indecisive like me. The milkshakes (extra thick please!) are to die for. I usually stick with the standard vanilla, but they have tons of other flavors ranging from chocolate and coffee, to strawberry and black cherry.

"379入手,属于不高不低的价格,有人秒杀319得的,但这种机会太少了,我觉得我这个很值了。这个豆浆是9月25买的,九月三十一号到,到手一看,和评论说的一样是老款,(你们想知道老款是什么样子的,就在看大图的最后一张点开来看)。一般不仔细看是找不到的,其实新老款对于我来说没什么,反正价格在这管是吧,机器好就行。问题是机器又出问题了,送的杯子是破的,机器也不能用,找商家联系,立刻答应包邮给我换,态度非常好,这里赞一个,希望给我送机器那家商家越做越好啊。二号返回去,节假日8号才收到,中间省去环节,14号发出来,20号收到,快递相当的慢。本来心情很不好,去拿快递后,打开一看,运过来的竟然是新款就是和图片上一样的,好了,说说这两天试豆浆机的效果。。。 最开始那个坏的豆浆机打一下就不动了,那声音绝对能把睡觉的叫醒,不吹牛,太可怕。后来这款豆浆机把东西到进去,加上水后,它要先预热打一下,那一下声音挺大的,每次打都被吓到。然后它要煮沸啦,煮沸后又开始打了,声音不大,轻轻的,很不错,一会儿又煮,来来回回20分钟吧,就好了,然后灯就闪,就好了。没用过豆浆机,还以为买回来的又是坏的呢,为啥不打呢想着,哈哈题外话。豆子磨的很细,没有腥味,非常满意,我觉得买的超值,nice",positive,zh,2

"Well, the beds were clean with plump pillows and were exceptionally comfortable. The room was very clean but as some of the reviews stated, a little worn. The toilets have some flushing and water-level issues, but engineering told me they were going to be changed. It's a nice Sheraton with an indoor pool and restaurant, Starbucks Express and little store for incidentals and snacks and a spa!!. There's probably a fitness room but I did not look. Room service, the staff, everyone is super nice and helpful. It was just outdated...all dressed up in various shades of *brown* The air conditioning worked really well and in the Ft Worth heat that was a huge plus. Noise in the hallway could be very disturbing and I wish people would remember to be considerate in the hallways. Note - while it is fairly close to the convention center, and definitely walkable, once inside the convention center it could be another 15 minute walk to get to the part where your particular event is. I lost a few pounds that week for all the walking I did. No complaints there. I ate at the Hilton during the day, right across the street from the Convention Ctr. The Omni Hotel was hopping. If you want a hip, happenin' hotel where the HUMMER's and Porsches park, seems like the Omni was the place to be. However, if you can handle a safe, affordable and not-too-many frills hotel, the Sheraton works just fine. I enjoyed the crab sandwich on croissant from the restaurant and what I loved was the little store carried Thymes bath salts and lotions. There's a spa in the Sheraton also. It is not Sheraton's, but it is nice. Looks are deceiving as it's about 8,000 sq feet, and much nicer than it appears online. Still....not over the top but trying. I can't gush over the hotel, but I can't put it down either. While it lacked pizzazz, it worked and it had some nice amenities (indoor pool). I would definitely stay there again, even if just to lose the weight. There were 5 computers in the lobby which was sufficient for collecting mail, browsing the internet, etc. I used the Super Shuttle to get to/from the airport so there was no parking issue. That was $19 plus tip from DFW airport.",neutral,en,1

"My husband and I went to this restaurant during the past holidays. Needless to say, given Jean George's reputations, we had very high expectations. I mean, after all, Jean George is a celebrity chef!\n\nWe picked out a couple of the restaurant's signature steak dishes and an appetizer. My steak was cooked ok but my husband's was overcooked( he had asked for medium rare.). Another thing that we find strange was that we were served with 4 different sauces to go with our steaks. For us, this was the first because we had never been served any type of sauces in any high-end steakhouse. High quality steaks shouldn't require any condiments other than salt and pepper!\n\nOur overall dining experience was extremely disappointing. We expect better everything especially when we paid $300+ for a couple of steaks and an appetizer!",negative,en,0

I don't remember the name of the dish I ordered, but what I do remember is that it was a fish dish and the fish was dry, the broth/sauce was too salty, not to mention, the portion was ridiculously tiny. \n\nEven though I was not impressed with their food, I enjoyed their bread a lot, especially their fig bread. \n\nI expected more from this restaurant and this place had definitely failed to live up to its reputation.",negative,en,0

"I like underdogs. So, 12 years after having first seen Star Trek V, and thinking it was bizarrely bad, I gave it a second watch, hoping I would find some redeeming quality which I missed the first time around.I didn't.The writing is half-baked, and although at first the quality of the acting is stable enough to keep the movie on its feet (albeit shakily), the further we get into the plot the sillier it gets. The last quarter of the film is just plain ridiculous. What was even worse, from the original cast's POV, is that this was the first ST movie to be released AFTER the franchise returned to television with Next Generation, and the average episode of Next Generation would put this to shame* - including the special effects! What an embarrassment.The Final Frontier isn't thoroughly wretched - I gave it 4 out of 10 - but it's so far below the standard of its predecessors (yes, including the first one) that the only reason I can think of to watch it is because you'll appreciate the other movies more.* unless it's an episode with Troi's mother in it.",negative,en,0

"Due to this show getting cut early I never realized why until I recently read the story behind the series. I felt this show never got its dues as one of the greatest shows, this show is iconic in nature and deserves the movie it was always intended to have if not with the original A team cast at least with the cast incorporated into the story line or a lengthy cameo, perhaps at the end commemorate it to the late Col. Hanibal Smith(Preppard). This cast gave so much to bring happiness to us growing up they deserve one last heave ho the fact that the series ended openly because they slashed the series is reason enough. This crew and cast made us realize as children the essence of being one of the good guys especially seeing how screwed up the world is today, I think a milder version like the original should be put into motion I have already read the previews and I know these are not the plans but if anything a straight to DVD movie, I sure would buy it. I really do not get how crappy shows get series finales but this great show which still runs regularly today and probably gets watched more than some of the current garbage shows of today don't we will always remember the Incredible Hulk series, Knight Rider, Airwolf, and the A team because those kind of shows carry through time, I am almost positive these knew ones you see about detectives will not even be remembered in 10 years so why not bring back something and show the people what staying power is all about and how these old shows really are all about.",positive,en,2

As we relaxed in lobby chairs each afternoon, we watched a homeless man enter the building, go to the lobby bathrooms to use for shaving and other activities for 30-45 minutes with no interventions by security or front office...probably because all of their eyes are down or they are busy talking to one another instead of greeting the guests or watching who comes in and out of hotel.
The restaurant, Urbane, was fabulous with great food and service. The coffee bar staff was pleasant and they make an excellent coffee to accompany homemade bakery items from Urbane.

"This cafe is tucked at the far end of an industrial enclave in subang jaya. New patrons may find it a chore to locate it as there were no clear signages.

"My family and I stayed at the Hudson for three nights. The guest rooms are VERY small. They have one full size, uncomfortable platform bed and a small desk (not large enough to work on). The televisions are mounted on the side wall making watching television in bed difficult. One side of the bathroom is separated from the bedroom by a sheer curtain. The entire bathroom is approximately 3X7ft including the shower area!. Outlets are scarce, so charging a cel phone and a laptop simultaneously is a challenge.

"Less useful in winter
This is my first weather station. Perhaps I'm expecting too much from these systems. I live in upstate New York where it snows. I purchased this system to be able to see more than just outdoor temperature and humidity. When it snows (which is pretty much all winter) the anemometer and wind vane get covered in snow and can't turn. Therefore, I am not able to see wind speed or direction in the winter. Also, the solar panel is covered in snow many inches deep. So, I guess the only additional parameter I can see that is not available from the cheap temp/humidity sensors is barometric pressure. I'm hoping for better functionality in the summer. Although a manual is included, it does not give enough information about the display. For example, the wind gust indicator (yes, I was able to see wind speed for a few days before it snowed) does not indicate the time window. Is that the biggest gust in the past hour? day? since midnight? The book does not explain. There is an up/down arrow next to the barometric pressure, which I am assuming indicates if the pressure is rising or falling--a reasonable assumption, but the book does not explain. There is in addition a number next to it which, again I'm assuming means the change in pressure over some period of time. What period? There is just not enough explanation. The engineer or technical writer who put the manual together did not put themselves in the mindset of a customer who does not know what they know. I'm an engineer and write manuals to explain my products. I will occasionally get a customer ask a question, and I will direct them to the answer in the manual. I understand that most people do not want to read manuals these days, but some do, and the information should be there. The lack of explanation in the manual is not the reason for lack of 5 stars. I had hoped this weather station would function in snowy weather. Do not mount this where you cannot get to it to clear the snow regularly. I am contemplating rigging up a remote air gun to blast the snow off the unit.",neutral,en,1

"Ive stayed a this hotel several times in 2012. This Hyatt Place is an old Amerisuites. I'm not sure when they uggraded the hotel but it's been a while at this point. The lobby is nice and the staff is friendly and attentive. The rooms are pleasant at first look, but after staying a night you'll get that feeling that something's not right.
The carpet and couches are worn and faded, the shower/bath tubs are in various states of repair, the tv only gets about 20 channels including the Japanese network, the wifi is very slow and cuts out often. The lights in the rear parking lot are never working and it can feel a unsafe back there at night (hotel backs up to a dark noeghborhood). Worst of all the rooms have a HUMID feel to them, like something flooded and they've attempted to cover it up.
The Hyatt Place does have decent food and the location can't be beat: right next the Alamo Quarry Market where you'll find tons of shopping and restaraunts; positioned ideally at loop 410 and US 281. Also the staff is always professional and friendly. I still stay here from time to time, but it's my second or third choice.",negative,en,0

"I'm a Kimpton InTouch member; wherever I travel, I try to stay in a Kimpton Hotel. In fact, one of my favorite hotels is a Kimpton (shoutout to the Burnham Hotel in Chicago!) After staying at a dozen or so Kimptons in half a dozen cities (some cities have more than one Kimpton hotel), I have come to realize that not all Kimpton hotels have the same standards.
Sadly, I must put the San Diego Solamar in the ""lower standard"" category. Maybe it was nicer a few years ago when it was newer; but, it's in decline now. A few positives: central location; coffee in the morning; wine in the early evening; free NY Times (even Sunday edition); outdoor patio; good wireless reception throughout building; nice enough front-desk staff. Now for the not-so-positive: the mattresses are old and need replacement (or flipping): there are large indentations from where people have slept. The rooms are spare: perhaps this isn't much of an issue except that Kimpton touts itself as being stylish--hotel pictures show a lovely room with pillow shams and blanket throws but, the rooms no longer contain these items. Also, cabinet doors didn't close properly because the hinges were loose and worn. The carpet leading into the room was bare and torn. These small things contributed to an overall feeling of decline; maybe the room was pretty nice five years ago but now it seems a little bit shabby. Another negative: I'm a Kimpton InTouch member and the paper wasn't delivered to my door. Again, this is a small thing but 1) this is a service that Kimpton touts and 2) small things like this add up to a general sense of dissatisfaction.
All in all, I would not put the Solamar into the category of two stars, but it seems to be slipping into it. Kimpton needs to put this hotel onto the list of ""hotels to refurbish"".",negative,en,0

"Is it a murder mystery? Is it a police procedural? Is it a back-stage look at seedy French music halls? Quai des Orfevres is all of these, but more than anything else it's an amusing comedy of infidelity, jealousy and love, set in post-WWII Paris. It may be surprising that Henri- Georges Clouzot, the director of such grim films as Le Corbeau or such suspenseful nail- biters as Diabolique and The Wages of Fear, is the director of this one. Clouzot, however, was a shrewd film-maker. ""In a murder mystery,"" he tells us, 'there's an element of playfulness. It's never totally realistic. In this I share Hitchcock's view, which says, 'A murder mystery is a slice of cake with raisins and candied fruit, and if you deny yourself this, you might as well film a documentary.'"" Quai des Orfevres is a wonderful film, and it's no documentary. Jenny Martineau (Suzy Delair) is an ambitious singer at music halls and supper clubs. She's a flirt, she's sees nothing too wrong with using a bit of sex as well as talent to get a contract. Her stage name is Jenny Latour. And she really loves her husband, Maurice Martineau (Bernard Blier). Martineau is something of a sad sack. He's her accompanist and arranger. He's a bit balding, a bit chubby and jealous to a fault. Then we have their neighbor, the photographer Dora Monnier (Simone Renant). She's blond, gorgeous (think of Rita Hayworth) and capable. She and Martineau have been friends since they were children together. Dora, however, is definitely not thinking just of friendship when she looks at Jenny. Then comes along Georges Brignon (Charles Dullin), a wizened, rich and dirty old man, who often has Dora take ""art"" photographs of his young female proteges whom he poses himself. He offers a contract for a film to Jenny, and suggests a dinner at his home to discuss the details. Jenny is more than willing. Maurice is furious and forbids it. Jenny shouts right back at him, ""You're jealous of the rich! Well, I want my share of their dough. I'm all for royalty!"" ""You're dad was a laborer,"" Maurice shouts back. ""So what? Under Louis XV, I'd have been Madame de Pompadour! I'd have heated up their tights!"" And after Brignon is found dead with a smashed champagne bottle next to his bleeding skull, there's Dora to try to make things safe for Jenny. But wait. Inspector Antoine gets the case. Antoine (Louis Jouvet) is a tall, tired, middle-aged bachelor with sore feet. He has seen it all. He served in ""the colonies"" with the Foreign Legion and returned with an adopted baby and malaria. The child is now about eight-years old and Antoine dotes on him. One of the first things Antoine discovers is not only did someone brain Brignon with a bottle, someone shot him in the heart. Who did it? Before long Jenny, Maurice and Dora all are making up alibis, lying and, at one or another point, confessing. How will Antoine discover the murderer? Will we have a chance to see some great music hall songs sung by Jenny Latour? Everything becomes clear, but only with time and Detective Antoine's persistence. We are left with many kinds of love leading to all kinds of motives, from hair-trigger jealousy to longing glances...and all played with a nice mixture of Gallic amusement. Clouzot takes us to a Paris of seedy but not threatening neighborhoods, to downtrodden music publishers where tunes are played on the piano for buyers, to restaurants with discrete private dining rooms. Most of all, he takes us to the music hall where Jenny Latour often performs. We can see Jenny as she sings, with couples in the seats and single men wearing their coats and hats in standing room. And everyone smokes. The first third of the film, in fact, takes place largely in this milieu. With Jenny singing about ""Her petite tra-la-la, her sweet tra-la-la,"" we follow her from trying out the song at the publishers to a rehearsal to a saucy performance with Jenny in a feathered hat, a corset, gartered stockings and not much else. Delair, Blier and Renant all do wonderful jobs, but it Louis Jouvet who holds everything together. He was a marvelous actor who disliked making films. The stage was his world, and he took on films only if he happened to like the director and to make money to finance his stage work. Jouvet was tall with a long face and broad cheekbones. He was not conventionally handsome but he had what it takes to dominate a scene. For a look at how skillfully he could play comedy, watch him in Drole de Drame. He's a fascinating actor. At one point he says, ""I've taken a liking to you, Miss Dora Monnier."" ""Me?"" she asks. ""Yes. Because you and I are two of a kind. When it comes to women, we'll never have a chance."" Jouvet brings all kinds of nuances to that line, from rueful regret to a gentle amusement.",positive,en,2

"Up until the last 20 minutes, I was thinking that this is possibly Jackie Chan's worst movie (excluding his pre-1978 work, which I am not familiar with). The final fight sequence changed all that: it is long and good and intense - indeed, one of the highlights of Chan's career. But to get to it, you have to sit through a lot of ""comedy"" that might amuse five-year-olds (oh, look! someone threw a tomato at that guy's face) and endless ""football"" scenes. Not to mention the dubbing (which includes the line ""How can I turn it off? It's not a tap"" - watch to find out what it refers to). ""Dragon Lord"" is worth renting for the final fight alone, but the rest of the movie is only for Jackie collectors, and even then only for those who've already seen at least 15 of his other movies.

"I was so surprised when I saw this film so much underrated... I understand why some of you dislike this movie. Its pace is slow, a characteristic of Japanese films. Nevertheless, if you are absorbed in the film like me, you will find this not a problem at all.I must say this is the best comedy I have ever seen. ""Shall We Dansu?"" is often considered a masterpiece of Japanese comedies. It is very different from Hollywood ones, e.g. Austin Powers or Scary Movies, in which a gag is guaranteed in every couple of minutes. Rather, it is light-hearted, a movie that makes you feel good.I love the movie because it makes me feel ""real"". The plot is straightforward yet pleasing. I was so delighted seeing that Sugiyama (the main role) has found the meaning of life in dancing. Before I watched the film I was slightly depressed due to heavy schoolwork. I felt lost. However, this film made me think of the bright side of life. I believed I was in the same boat of Sugiyama; if he could find himself in his hobby, why couldn't I? It reminded me of ""exploring my own future"" and discovering the happiness in my daily life.It is important to note that the actors are not professional dancers. While some of you may find the dancing scenes not as perfect as you expect, I kinda like it as it makes me feel that the characters are really ""alive"", learning to dance as the film goes on.Over all, this film is encouraging and heart-warming. As a comedy, it does its job perfectly. It definitely deserves 10 stars.And yes Aoki is funny :-D",positive,en,2

"Trying to cash in on the success of Deal Or No Deal and 1 Versus 100 comes this lame excuse for entertainment - Show Me The Money, in which 12 sexy 'dancers' shimmy out in shiny red hooker attire. A contestant is given the beginning of a phrase, such as ""Which team lost . . ."" with three choices, A, B, or C, each which completes the phrase. The contestant has three chances to give an answer to one of these 3 choices. The host - William Shatner, at his obnoxious smarmiest - asks the contestant if he wants to ""lock into the answer"" and when the contestant says yes, he picks a 'dancer', to whom he yells ""Show me the money!"" She opens a scroll that has an amount, and if his answer was right, he adds that amount to his winnings; if he was wrong, the amount is subtracted. (So theoretically, it is possible for a contestant on this dreary debacle to actually wind up owing Shatner money.) There is also a ""Killer Card"" and if the contestant picks the girl who has that vile scroll, but he has answered properly, nothing happens. If he's answered wrong, the game goes into Sudden Death and has to answer another question. If he gets that one wrong, he leaves with nothing.Before going to commercials, Shatner yells, ""let's dance"" and Shatner, the contestant and the 12 dancers shake booty. At the end of the show, Shatner asks the ladies for ""a last dance"" and they all shake it some more.I give this show 6 episodes at the very most, at which time hopefully this pathetic excuse for a game will be shown the door. (It could've been worse - they could've somehow bribed Cuba Gooding Jr to be the host, although I bet he's a better dancer than 'Shat,' as they call him these days.)7/08: Guess what - I was wrong!

Thank goodness, for the reviews for the Fitzpatrick Grand Central! We loved it! The staff...all of them...from the bellman, the concierge, the front desk, the housekeeping, to the wait staff in the restaurant were all eager and willing to go the extra mile! We were in room 801 which was a King Jr. Suite. We faced the courtyard...so we had no street noise. Our room was very large. We had a very comfortable king bed with lots of great pillows. There was a a large mounted flat screen tv on the wall, a desk, and of course 2 end tables. The lighting was great. The sitting area which was separated by columns contained a great looking chest and lamp flanked by 2 club chairs. The coffee table contained interesting magazines and there was a flat screen on the wall. The bathroom was very large. It also featured a tv. The combination shower/jacuzzi bath was vert large. The bath and room was extremely clean and in tip top condition! The wonderful condition of our room and bath made us wonder if we were the first to stay in room 801! We loved the small size of the property. We loved the location. There are many great restaurants and shops in this area. Grand Central was a half a block away.

During Graduation Week, the hotel doubles its prices. This is a complete rip-off. The rooms are smallish and while the beds are good to sleep in, the wood frames have sharp corners that are unfortunately very hard to avoid and painful to encounter. The closets are tiny and about four hangers are provided. The bathrooms: we had a King bed room, which had a large shower. The door only opened out, so that after leaving the shower, the bathroom floor flooded, with water dripping down the door. We changed to a room with a tub/shower, but those rooms do not have King beds. There is only one sink. Worst of all, the walls are thin as paper. The entertainment is constant. We were treated to the sounds of our neighbors talking on the phone, using the bathroom, having friends over till late at night, fighting, making up….and the only thing we were not treated to were the sounds of silence. Parking costs $39 per night. Our car is parked on the street outside of the hotel (yes, we are still here while I am writing this). We are told that there is Security watching the cars. Right. The housekeeping has been good on some days, and for the past two days has been lousy. I hate having to call up for missing items and then having to tip the person bringing those items, when they should have been in the room in the first place. Breakfast (at $40/pp) has been decent but not worth the price. Thank goodness our son graduated. This is not a hotel we would ever stay at again. Give me The Rittenhouse any day, even if it is not near the University (and if only they had had rooms available). Oh, and by the way, that IPad? Nothing but a useless gimmick.",neutral,en,1

"I stay 40 nights a year on business with Holiday Inn / Holiday Inn Express ( Priority Club Platinum member ) In 2011 my family and I booked this with a connection to Sea World. For the money it worked and met our needs. ( close to Sea World, new - 3 meals downstairs and a bar ) - however I found the hotel very noisy. 2012 we are here again. So I feel I have a handle on a a review.....- 12 months apart
+ The walls are thin- again I stay 40 night plus a year - these are thin walls. Turn the stat to fan - or expect to hear your room next door - how a new hotel was built this way ( this bad ) is beyond me.
+ There are kids, - if your ok with kids going from door to door, running down the halls - check in... if your a parent reading this - keep your kids under control - ( YOUR NOT AT HOME )
If your trying to stay in this area - to get work done- consider another locations.
For a hotel need close to Sea-World, I believe the rate was in line with the room and location.
As others metioned in reviews- staff could use coaching, however my general impression is that it's a numbers game, there aren't enought staff, from front desk to cleaning to resturant for the volume of customers. The averager guest isn't that savy and the result is without better numbers or coaching this hotel will remain open and money making since it feeds off it's location. Not due to it's own work.",neutral,en,1
"I've got both good and bad comments about this place, so I'm only giving them an even 3 stars. This is my fourth time at this airport, and overall my feels on it are 'meh'- not good but not bad. \n\nThe Good:\nSecurity was fast and friendly. I was through the line in about 10 minutes, and cleared to go in about 20 total. I opt out of the body scanners, which takes a little longer but lessons the radiation I'm exposed too. I'm all about saving my future self from slowly dying of radiation poisoning after 20 years of going through body scanners. \nThe airport itself is pretty- one of the prettiest I've been too. They have a tree lined terminal with giant windows on one side, risking chairs to sit and reflect, and lots of shops and even a spa to visit if you're laid over here (or misread your flight time and arrive three hours early like me). They have free wifi, clean facilities, a variety of food choices, and an overall friendly atmosphere. As I write this I'm seating in the waiting area by my gate, and the chairs are surprisingly comfy. Not your standard cold, hard, awkwardly uncomfortable chairs. \n\nThe Bad:\nThings are EXPENSIVE. By things I mean food and beverages. I know they jack up prices in airports, but $18 for two breakfast tacos and a sprite is absurd. That's like end of the world pricing. \nAs I try to save this draft, I notice that their free wifi wont let me continue without an error message. I have since turned off my wifi and am on my phone's 3G instead. No problems anymore, but I think the wifi is useless if you can't navigate pages online. \nThe woman who did my opt out patting down was a moron. Apparently she just couldn't grasp the concept that I was traveling with a laptop, a laptop bag, and a carry-on suitcase. I spent a good three minutes trying to make her understand that all three of the boxes/tray/item holders that people use to put their stuff through the X-ray were mine. A sample of our conversation:\nMe: 'I have the laptop, the next container, and the black suitcase' :points to all three:\nHer: 'the laptop is yours?' :points to laptop:\nMe: 'yes, and the next two items' :points again:\nHer: 'so not the laptop, this bag is yours?'\nMe: 'the laptop IS mine, and the bag, and the suitcase. All of them are mine' :points again:\nHer: 'so just the suitcase?'\nOH. MY. GOSH. Are you an idiot???? How many ways do I need to say this for you to understand???? And you're supposed to be 'protecting' citizens from terrorists?? You can't grasp the concept of traveling with three items, what the hell are you good for? Unfortunately, I can't really curse out a TSA agent without facing potential black-listing, and as much as I enjoy the airport ('they have chairs....') I don't want to become a real life Tom Hanks and live in the airport. So I just shut up and let her figure it out, with the help of a coworker. \n\nI think airports should have a resident MD on staff at the ticket counter to dispense Xanax to make the flying process less stressful. I'd give an airport 5/5 for sure if that ever happens. Hey, a girl can dream, right?",negative,en,0

"Here is why I am rating this only two stars when I love the food: \nWe got there earlier than usual on a Friday night (around 7), and there were no seats at the bar, which is where we've been lucky enough to sit in the past. So we are seated in the way back by the bathroom Would be okay, except that I can SMELL that urinal cake smell from the bathroom. I get that they need to seat people back there, but they have to keep it CLEAN. I am smelling bathroom odors and my husband is smelling garbage odors from the trash can right next to us that is OVERFLOWING with garbage. Seriously? There is garbage on the floor right next to where we are seated. Between these two things, we considered leaving, but we thought the people next to us were going to be leaving soon, and we figured we could grab their seats. I got a whiskey, and it was seriously a much, much smaller pour than I've gotten in the past. I didn't love our waitress. She mixed up my order with my husband's. (I ordered my burger medium rare and got it medium well, and his medium well burger was served to him medium rare.) She came to check on us, but obviously didn't care what the answer was, because my husband's answer of, \""Good, except....\"" was cut off promptly as she walked away. I love sitting at the bar, and I love their burgers, but to sit in the back with the servers was painful! Oh, and leaves of lettuce had fallen out of the refrigerator that is right there in the table area, and I watched the servers walk past them about ten times without sweeping anything up. It was just one of our worst restaurant experiences in a while, and it was really disappointing and icky.",negative,en,0

"Caffe Boa has definitely been an interesting place to visit. My husband and I bought a Groupon to Caffe Boa and attempted to use it 3 weeks ago. We arrived at 7:00, and were directed to the bar, where we waited, and thankfully were entertained by a friendly bartender. After waiting about 10 minutes we were seated directly inside the front door. It was a place I never would have put a table, but we were hungry so we didn't request a different table. Our server came out, told us the specials, bla bla bla. He was so soft-spoken we could barely hear a single thing he said. After over an hour our server reappeared and apologized for our wait and told us that our food would be out shortly. After another half hour and a visit from the manager insisting that our food would be out imminently the food arrived. The fried chicken was flavorless while the greens tasted as though the chef had accidentally poured in too much salt. I took one bite, my husband took another and we returned the dish and shared my husband's voodoo penne, which was mediocre, but we were hungry and it was edible. We were given a $50 and promised that future dining experiences would be better.\n\nWe returned 2 weeks later, had a lovely supper with and a delightful, knowledgeable and prompt server named Justin. I ordered the risotto with pork belly and my husband ordered the lasagne. The meal wasn't anything I couldn't have made at home, but it tasted good, our wine was superb and we were happy. Justin suggested the macarons for dessert-- They were INCREDIBLE! Hands down the best macarons I've ever eaten and I not only make them myself but have eaten them all over the world. The macarons and our server are the only reasons I didn't give Caffe Boa a 1 star review.\n\nWell we forgot to use our Groupon on our second meal so alas, last night we attempted to go out to supper again. We had a 7:00 reservation, were seated promptly and given water and some stale bread and mayo/butter/olive oil stuff to dip it in. We ordered immediately upon seeing our server, Justin, again. Over an hour passed and still no food. The tables near us not only didn't have food, but did not have water since the restaurant had run out of water glasses, and appeared to have been given complimentary wine instead. Did we get free wine for our wait? Nope. Justin did offer to bring us more bread, then returned to inform us that the bread was in the oven and would be done momentarily. 20 minutes later there was still no bread and no supper. Being hungry, tired and frustrated we left. Justin stopped us and took our name and phone number so a manager could call us today. So far, no call. \n\nI still have the stupid Groupon to use.\n\nAt this rate it would probably be in our best interest just to request the money back from Groupon instead of trying to dine at Caffe Boa. Perhaps foolishly, I did make a reservation for Sunday, I'm going to give them one last chance... wish us luck!!",negative,en,0
"I haven't yet read the Kurt Vonnegut book this was adapted from, but I am familiar with some of his other work and was interested to see how it would be translated to the screen. Overall, I think this is a very successful adaptation of one of Vonnegut's novels. It concerns the story of an American living in Germany who is recruited as a spy for the US. His job is to ingratiate himself with high ranked Nazi's and send secret messages to the American's via his weekly radio show. But when the war ends he is denounced as a war criminal but escapes to New York, where various odd plot twists await.If Mother Night has a problem it's that it tends to get a little too sentimental at times. But for most of the film the schmaltz is kept to a minimum and the very strange plot is carried through with skill and aplomb. And there are some fabulous moments of black comedy involving three right wing Christian fundamentalists and a very highly ranked Nazi in a prison cell. Very much recommended.",positive,en,2
"Definitely a yummy and unique experience. Ordered the Sage Fried Chicken and Waffles plate to share with my wife. Two plump, juicy, flavorful chicken breast fried golden brown were served over 4 Belgian waffles and topped with fried leeks with a maple reduction and spicy chili oil with diced bell peppers. Simply amazing. All of the flavors worked really well together and the portion was more than enough for 2 adults (we could have actually shared the waffles with our 3 year old. We got him a kids lil tractor breakfast: One giant pancake, scrambled eggs, and a slice of bacon. He ate 1/2 of the pancake and the bacon. So the only thing that we didn't love was the price. They kind of gauge you on the drinks and the kids meal prices -- which aren't exactly comparable to other restaurants. I totally understand, \""you get what you pay for,\"" and don't get me wrong, the food was great. But a $40+ bill after tip for one adult meal, one kid meal, and 2 coffees is kind of a bit much. It cheapened the experience. Oh, and even though it doesn't state it on the menu, the waitress said there was a $3 split charge. She tells us if we order something else that they can count it as a meal and waive the split -- I know, it didn't make sense to me either. So we order a side of scrambled eggs al a carte -- which we didn't eat -- and never got the plate split. I kind of felt tricked into spending a whole $3 more. Again, 3 bucks not a big deal, but it cheapened the experience.",neutral,en,1

"We arrived for a 3 night stay. As an SPG member I had booked the stay using some of my points. I then paid an additional fee to upgrade to a club level room....more on that later...
Initial impressions were good. The airport shuttle bus was prompt, and the driver had a list to advise any unaware guests which tower they were in. (the marina tower forms the primary element of the hotel, and the bay tower is a few minutes walk away-I believe this tower used to be a westin)
The lobby was modern and well furnished. We checked in and the member of staff assigned us a room on the 8th floor. I reminded him of my club level reservation and he reassigned me an 11th floor room (it later transpired that this is not a club floor either) although he clearly wasn't happy about being challenged. Whether this was overbooking or oversight I have no idea.
The room was nicely decorated, but small. If you are a family bear in mind that if you book a room with 2 beds they are doubles, not queens. It was also clearly not a clubroom, as it had none of the advertised amenities. We tried to address this with the hotel directly, but they simply weren't interested. I got the impression that they routinely sell club level upgrades without actually assigning a club floor room, which are on the 12th floor only.
The bathroom was in reasonable decorative order, but it was dirty. Tiles had a thin film of sludge on them and there was dust on all but the most visible areas. On the subject of cleaning, the hotel offers guests the option to forego housekeeping for the duration of their stay in lieu of either 500 starpoints, or $5 off your bill. This is an admirable idea, except when I did the maths it was clear that the only benefactor is the hotel. The points cost the hotel next to nothing, and $5 off your bill probably costs them $1, tops. In exchange for that I waive 3 days of housekeeping, which says something about the value the hotel assigns to room cleaning and the staff that provide it. I declined on that basis.
This was just one example of a management policy which appears to view the people paying to stay there as revenue generating opportunities, not guests. $22 a day to self park (on a dirt lot) $12 for daily internet, $20 for a rollaway, and hugely overpriced food and beverages are some others.
This is a real shame, because the club lounge was great, with decent breakfast and snacks in the evenings, the pools were nice, and the setting and views were superb.
This hotel is fundamentally decent, but it is let down by the way it is run. I really wanted to like this hotel, and I rarely write negative reviews, but in this instance I had no choice.",negative,en,0

After the basic version download ( die hard fan here on a dial-up modem ) eventually got here I hit my first snag.

Going to be hard to spread the word about it if normal users cant even open it...The Film. Beautiful soundtrack, superb lighting, masterful camera work and flawless texturing. Everything looked real. And then the two main characters moved.... and spoke... And the movie died for me. Everything apart from the lip syncing and the actual animation of the two main characters ( except for Proog in the dancing scene ) looked fluid and totally alive. The two main characters were animated so poorly that at times i was wondering if there are any games on the market at the moment with cut-scenes that entail less realism than this.Any frame in the movie is fantastic.. as a frame, and the thing is great if neither actors are moving. I'm so glad i haven't actually recommended this to anyone. I'd ruin my reputation.Oh, and final fantasy had a more followable and cunningly devised plot.this movie would get 10 stars if it wasn't for the tragedy that sits right there on the screen.",negative,en,0

"Today was my 1st time at CFT. And I have to admit...it was really REALLY good!\n\nI love the laid back atmosphere. The waitress was the BEST! I work in the service industry and I always expect amazing customer service everywhere I go, and she deserves 5 stars! I hate coming to a new restaurant and the wait staff doesn't explain the menu/concept. She was very very thorough and so personable. Some wait staff can be a little too personable and it can get annoying. But she was the perfect amount. She explained the menu very well to someone like me who is very indecisive. And our drinks and chips were never empty (and we had a table of 8). \n\nI think some people may not like the salsa. It's mainly corn, red onion, tomatoes, lemon juice, cilantro, and maybe some green peppers. I loved it. Nice and simple. I had the tuna rancheros. It was so good! The tuna was cooked perfectly and the tomatoes were so juicy and sweet. I had a bite of my friend's beer battered shrimp taco and it was amazing. I regretted not getting it, but oh well, I'll just have to go back!\n\nI will definitely be back...very soon!",neutral,en,1

"A rather lame teen slasher from Brisbane. While the plot hinges on a fairly decent idea, the writing is profoundly lame and two of the three main teens are absurdly wooden. The problem is that for the kids to go through with their plan they have to be far more reckless than shown, but if they were that devil-may-care, it would perhaps be hard for them to be likable, so they end up being neither really. In fact, I only started enjoying the film when I started wishing for their death. One of those movies where in about a thousand places the most sensible option would be to call the police. I realise we wouldn't have a movie if they did, but it would be nice if we could believe that they actually wouldn't. Avoid.",negative,en,0

"Going for something far away from the deliberately gross stuff that he usually makes, John Waters (happy birthday, John!) made this parody of the celebrity/art world. Edward Furlong plays the title character, a working-class teenager in Baltimore who loves to photograph things. When a New York agent (Lili Taylor) discovers his work, she offers him his big break, which he accepts. But once he hits it big, he has to reconsider everything.Basically, ""Pecker"" looks at how he loses his friends and his normal life once he becomes a celebrity. The sort of thing that we might expect, sure, but with Waters directing, there's always a few things to shock us (you'll know them when you see them). I certainly recommend it. Also starring Christina Ricci, Mink Stole and Patty Hearst.",positive,en,2
"My wife and I were scheduled to stay at Le Meridien for a few days as part of a larger road trip across the southwest. We booked the hotel based off the rave reviews on Trip Advisor. But after staying only one night at this hotel, we had to check out and find other accommodations in Dallas.
The problems started with the open concept of the hotel itself. Few reviews mention this, but the hotel is designed with an open-air concept that exposes most rooms to the expansive lobby/bar/elevator areas. The rooms are not sufficiently sound-proofed to limit the reverberant noises originating from the main floor. In fact, at 2am we heard a piece of silverware fall onto the lobby's marble floor from ten floors up. Not to mention earlier in the evening when we were subjected to loud music and crowd noise from the bar area. Bottom line, if noise is an issue for you...take note.
Second, as a four-star property we expected the room to be immaculate. The bathroom floors had stray hairs in the corners; the walls and doors were worn and chipped. And the bathtub was far from new. There is a fridge in the room, but it doesn't work.
Third, wireless internet service is complimentary, but when we arrived we were told that they were having server issues. In other words, no wifi anywhere in the hotel. They gave us an ethernet cord to connect in our room, but that did not work, either. The only place where the internet worked was in the business office on the main level, which was busy with fellow travelers checking their emails. The hotel staff had no idea if or when the wi-fi service would be back.
The hotel staff was very courteous and helpful, and some of these issues were certainly out of their control. In fact, they understood why we wanted to check out early. But it baffles us that this property can earn a four-star rating with the kind of noise and cleanliness issues we encountered.",negative,en,0

"Clean, pleasant, convenient location, and a great restaurant. That sums up our experience with this hotel. It was easy to reach by driving (granted, we didn't come in during rush hour) and even better, once we parked most of the subway lines were just a short walk from the hotel. We decided to have a drink in the 20th floor restaurant and that turned out to be a great decision. The restaurant was quiet, pretty, and the service was personable and efficient. It is only open for the hotel guests so it wasn't crowded and the balcony view over the 911 Memorial Pool and up the skyline of Manhattan was beautiful. The food was very good too. Since it was late we stayed away from a full meal but we shared a couple salads and appetizers that were fresh and delicious. All in all, it was a great experience and I would definitely stay at this hotel again.",positive,en,2

So, why 2 stars? There are serious problems with their reservation and billing process.
My wife made reservations in July for our arrival on the 1st of September. I called the day before or arrival to let them know that our flight lands at 11 PM their time and we would be very late getting there. When we arrived around 1AM we were informed that our reservation had been canceled by management earlier that day. Thankfully the person at the desk was able to find and reinstate our reservation. After about 30 minutes we were checked in.
Due to issues around my wife's reimbursement for the trip we reserved another night under my name through Travelocity. I have now been billed for my Travelocity night (as a no-show) and for the night as though we just walked up and asked for a room. 3 days of phone calls and no resolution.

"I saw this at the 2008 Palm Springs International Film Festival. There are some wonderful descriptions of this film from other commenter's here and they seemed to have really enjoyed it so I won't too far into giving a film synopsis but you could see a little of Woody Allen and maybe a little of Federico Fellini in this film's collection of some 50 short sketches or vignettes strung together with no real singular plot. A few of the vignettes are related to each other in their character and plot lines however and a a corner bar is used frequently as a central scene where they are always giving last call. The beginning and ending scenes have a common theme too that bookends the film. It took three years to film this and much of the time must have been spent on finding the plainest and homeliest looking people in all of Sweden to make the cast. This is Sweden's official submission for Best Foreign Language Film for the 2007 Academy Awards. It's a nice movie but hardly worthy of an official submission for best foreign film. Last year Sweden's official submission was the very weak Farväl Falkenberg and the year before it was expensive looking but dull ZoZo, so once again Sweden will have no chance in picking up the Oscar. This film has it's moments and would have made a good 20-25 minute short film but it gets a little old and cold for a full length feature film. Roy Andersson directs. Gustav Danielsson is the cinematographer. Editor Anna Märta Waern deserves a lot of credit for the work she must have put into this. Benny Andersson of ABBA fame provides an entertaining music score. It's an interesting film with a lot of dry humor and I did like it but It's nothing really special and could only give it a 7.0 out of 10.",positive,en,2

"This place has potential, and I hope they will do good in their business. I ordered a coconut soup, temple of fire (fried rice), Kimow (clear noodle), and a Thai tea. The coconut soup didn't taste too bad overall, however, it was over sweetened. It tasted like sweet coconut milk mixed with other staff.The temple of fire is way too spicy ( I love spicy food and I'm from Szechuan), but I couldn't handle the fried rice here. It gave me stomachache. The Kimow was average, a lot of noodles but minimum meat. The Thai tea was so sweet, I felt I was drinking syrups. The restaurant only has small round tables for two, Not convenient for group of three or more. It would be great if they allowed their customers to select spicy level (mild, median, hot, Thai hot etc.), otherwise it's too risky to order spicy dishes. I would get to go dishes from here, the actually dine/in portion is smaller other Thai restaurants' dishes anyway.",negative,en,0

Example, passion fruit and mango do not taste like they should in my opinion.

Actually the people at the front desk are personable and friendly but the bellhop had to be paged 5 or 6 times before he showed up to get us our luggage. I understand the hotels are limited in space and the small size of the room did not bother me. What did bother me was a lose bathroom faucet, a broken bathroom shelf and a window that wouldn’t close all the way so I was able to hear the street noise all night long. The elevators are unusually small and used by room service which makes it quite snug for 3 people and a cart of food. The bed was way too soft and seemed to failing in the middle.

Incredible food (enjoyed a lobster sandwich for lunch), excellent service, rarely a crowd, and, BTW, children under 12 eat free here!\r\n\r\nThe Pinot Brasserie is conveniently located on the casino level just as you enter the area of restaurants, stores and the ticket box office linking the Sands meeting rooms to The Venetian.",neutral,en,1
"When Comparing Ramsey steak to other steak houses, I would say they're about average, nothing special. The service was pretty good, except the fact that, when my sister order a medium steak and got a medium rare steak and told them about it, all they did was reheat it. At most other high end steak resturants I've been to they take more pride in their steak and make sure it's done right and make you a brand new steak. I was a little dissappointed considering Ramsey has such high standards on his show",negative,en,0
Had a yummy lunch here after strolling around the gardens. Tried the beet salad with chicken and it was delicious! My 3 year old daughter had the hot dog and fries which she enjoyed. I really wanted to sit outside as it looked really pretty out on the patio but my daughter wanted to sit inside and she was HUNGRY so didn't want to upset her further! It was nice inside also as there is plenty of natural light and you still have views of the patio area. The staff were very helpful and friendly. We will definitely have lunch here again next time we go to the gardens.,neutral,en,1
"The worst Wrestlemania ever.This had no must see bouts and many crap ones at that. This took place in Las Vegas and WWE made it's employees dress up like Egyptian gods! They even changed Howard Finkels name to Finkus Maximus, which probably doesn't mean anything. The sight of seeing Jim Ross in that terrible gown still gives me nightmares to this day and I'm 21 years old, so you could imagine it when I was 7 years old! Bobby Heenan was funny though.Matches included The Undertaker vs Giant Gonzales in a p*ss poor match, The Headshrinkers vs The Steiner Brothers in a useless match, Doink vs Crush in a comedy match and a boring match featuring Razor Ramon vs Bob Backlund. Hulk Hogan teamed up with Brutus Beefcake to battle Money Inc. You could clearly see Hogan had a black eye. In storyline purposes Ted DiBiase and IRS beat up Hogan while he was playing poker or something like that in the casinos, which is a poor storyline, but in reality, Macho Man Randy Savage hit Hogan because Savage thinks he's like The Hulk (no pun intended) no not the wrestler but the film character.The main event consisted of Bret 'Hitman' Hart facing off against Yokozuna in a very boring main event match. Mr Fuji threw salt in the face of Hart and Yoko won, but not until Hogan came down and squashed Yoko in 21 seconds.Overall Grade - E",negative,en,0

"We had previously never stayed at a Baymont property, but I am a Wyndham Rewards member & have stayed at many Wyndham properties without any problems. We decided to try this Baymont hotel and I reserved this hotel stay online & guaranteed it with my debit card. I called the hotel a couple of days later & requested that they make note on my reservation to please do not make any charges to my debit card, that I would be paying cash at check-in & would need a crib. The day we were to check-in I again called several hours prior to our arrival to reminded them that I did not want them to charge my debit card, that I would be paying cash at check-in & that we needed a crib. When I arrived to check-in, I stated right away that I would be paying cash for my 2 day stay so please do not charge my debit card. After a couple of minutes the clerk made the statement ""and you want to leave this on your credit card."" I immediately said ""NO!"" I told you I will pay cash. (At this point I already had the cash laying on the counter.)She took my cash & just as she printed the registration slip & handed it to me to sign, I received a text on my cell phone from Chase alerting me a charge had been made to my debit card. I asked the clerk if she charged my credit card & she quickly responded ""No, you paid cash"". When we arrived to the room, there was no crib in the room & the bathroom was absolutely nasty. Hairs in the tub & on the floor, there were black feet prints in the bottom of the tub & nasty dust/hairs along the base of the tub/floor area. Around the base of the toilet it was nasty & gross. There were also hairs on the counter of the sink area. The room had a musty odor. The beds were comfortable, but the comforters had an unpleasant odor so I removed them from our beds. After walking around the room without shoes, my grandson's white socks quickly became black from the dirty carpets. Later we discovered there was a food wrapper & crumbs behind the nightstand. I then called the front desk to notify her that there was no crib in the room & that we really needed one. She said she would see what she could do. After almost two hours we still had no crib. I called back to the clerk & explained that we were traveling with a baby that had special needs & needed a crib to sleep in. She seemed put out that I needed a crib & again said ""I will see what I can do"". ""They have already left"". I explained that I had made several crib requests prior to us arriving & we really needed one. About 45 minutes later the maintenance man delivered us a crib. Meanwhile I looked up my debit card account online to discover that she had charged the full amount of our stay to my debit card. I called the clerk & explained that there was a charge to my debit card. She quickly got an attitude with me and started off telling me she did not charge my card. When I explaind that I could see the charges online she then said ""Oh, that is only an authorization."" Long story short - this caused those funds to be tied up on my account for 5 days. We will never stay at this hotel in the future & I strongly suggest that they ""deep clean"" these rooms & better train their room attendants on how to clean a room. They also need to better train their front desk clerks on their opperating systems and the proper steps to take when guests' want to pay cash and do NOT want their credit/debit cards authorized/charged. I am just very disappointed with this stay!",negative,en,0

"We stayed at this hotel for one night in July 2011 so that we could see Memphis, visit Graceland, and keep travelling north. We had reserved a 2 Queen Bed suite with a pull-out sofa since there were 3 adults in our party. We arrived around 8pm on a Saturday night and were given our room. After unloading all of our luggage and starting to leave for dinner, one of us sat down on the pull out twin bed from the sofa and fell all the way through to the floor. There were no springs underneath! Thankfully no one was hurt and we proceeded to the front desk to ask for another room. We were given another room and went to dinner before we repacked up and moved our stuff. Once we got back at 10p and loaded up our stuff to move, we realized they had given us a room directly across from the elevator and next door to the ice/soda machines. We were too exhausted at this point to move again. Then we realized we had no sheets for the pull-out sofa and were told we had to come down to the front desk to get them as there was no one to help the front desk lady. (Really? No one?) Then we realized we had no towels and so we went back to the room we had left and moved those since we knew we would once again have to go help ourselves at the front desk. As we tried to sleep, we realized our air conditioner was old and made a horrible rattling noise whenever the compressor kicked on. Let's just say it was not a great experience and we were quite exhausted the next day. All of this for $149/night plus $12/night for parking. Ugh. The location is great and the carriages and pedestrian streets are wonderful at night. But there is no way I would try this hotel again. Not at this location.",negative,en,0
"I was a guest in August, there to photograph an AKC Dog Show that I have covered for several years at this location. I set up my backdrop & lighting on Thursday night in what has always been a locked Ballroom. I always finish up my setup before the start of each show so as to not spook any dogs. On Fri before the show I found my lighting equipment stolen as well as the crate for my medical alert dog. I soon found out that other vendors who were set up in a different area than I was were robbed as well.
The staff could have cared less. The manager would not come to speak to us about this. We asked to see the security camera film. We were told ""We do not have security cameras because it would give our guests a false sense of security.""
I asked what they would say if it was a child that had been taken? Guess cameras would be a good idea then. Later on I heard their excuse was that criminals were suing them for taking their photo without permission. REALLY??? Cameras are on our highways, in stores, & a part of our life. I do not buy that one either.
There were panhandlers asking guest for money as they entered their rooms, walked their dogs, & even right outside the ballroom. The panhandlers were bothering guests throughout the whole weekend.
We asked the hotel staff about stopping the panhandlers, giving them a description & they said ""We do not want to approach someone who might be a guest & risk insulting them.""
How about all the guests there who are already insulted by being robbed, harassed by panhandlers, etc? And the thefts took place over the whole weekend, it was not just one night. The manager, when he finally did come talk to us (I had to call cooperate for that to happen) Said he would pay the maintenance man to act as security at night. That went well. More thefts on Friday night. He was found sitting behind the front desk by my assistant when she went down for some Tums in the early morning hours. The doors by the ballroom with a sign that states ""Access by room key only from 11pm to 7am "" were duct taped & zip tied so they would not lock. I took photos of this. Bottom line is, the manager blamed us for the thefts. Said it was our fault. No concern what so ever for his guest or their safety.
Staff service for your room? We got up on Sunday morning to make coffee in our room to find housekeeping had not cleaned the pot from the day before or turned it off. Coffee still in the pot and the light was blinking. They had put new cups in & replenished the coffee packets to make more. That is all.
I have asked & asked for this hotel to do the right thing & replace my stolen equipment so I can do my job. I have been met with no sympathy or desire to do the right thing. Much less accept accountability.
Help from cooperate? Zero. They say it is a franchise & they have no control. Again, no accountability for someone who represents their name. Disgraceful!",negative,en,0
"This place is alright. I would've thought they'd get on the ball as far and lowering prices and upping selection ever since a BIG BAD RIVAL moved into Summerlin.

By far this hotel's strongest feature is it's location: about a block away from a red line metro station which can take you downtown or towards universal city/north Hollywood. It's also only a 15 minute walk to the walk of fame.
On the negative side, we could never get the shower warm enough and the pool area didn't look very inviting. Also, be prepared to get woken up by returning guests and police sirens if you decide to crash before 2am

"Foskoskies is one of my favorite places to eat in Charlotte. The food is consistently delicious. They focus on local ingredients, like Grateful Growers pork products. Their desserts are made in house and they nail them every time (they do an especially amazing job with cake), so share a meal if you have to but don't skip the sweet stuff. \n\nThis is one of those places that I don't have a particular favorite dish that I crave when I go there (except maybe the chicken and waffles at brunch - YUM!). I go there for the specials. They're always interesting and delicious. That goes for both dinner and brunch.\nThey do themed dinners every so often which are always fun. They have three or four courses, plus an alcohol pairing. Recently they did a Jameson Whiskey dinner. In the past they've had Greek themed dinners, and once they did a Grateful Growers/Duck Rabbit beer dinner that is in my top ten best meals of all time. \n\nAdd to all that delicious eating a friendly and attentive staff.

The menu looked to be nearly identical. I ordered a chili Verde burrito and it did not disappoint. There isn't a whole lot more to say. If anything it was a little cleaner than the average Roberto's and the self serve area with the red and green sauces had something I haven't seen anywhere else, freshly chopped jalapenos mixed with onions.

"Crepe Cafe was the first meal we had in Montreal. Had a late lunch after wandering down Rue de Notre Dame close to our hotel. Had read about this place when doing my research about Montreal, and I'm glad we walked by it during our first \""exploration\"" walk. Both my bf and I had a savory crepe for our meal, which included both a salad and fries. We both agreed that mine was better, which had chicken, ham, bechamel sauce and some vegetables. His a pretty good too - I think it had spinach, bechamel, and some other ingredients I can't quite remember. We shared a crepe suzette for dessert and it was quite delicious! He had a beer and I had a glass of wine. Pretty affordable for the meal.\n\nThe service was very nice and unobtrusive. As with other reviewers, I was practicing my French and our waiter was very patient and helpful.\n\nOverall, a great experience and we enjoyed it very much. Wish we had more time during our trip so we could have returned for another meal. I would have liked to try the croque-madame. Would highly recommend this place!",neutral,en,1
"Ordinarily I really enjoy movies like ""Chances Are,"" but I wasn't quite satisfied with this one for a few reasons. The first half was pretty well done overall, with Alex Finch dying and being reincarnated in a new body (played by Robert Downey Jr.). He meets up with his wife (Cybill Shepherd) and friend (Ryan O'Neal) and his daughter, who is now grown up. The scenes with them meeting again and Downey rediscovering who he once was are well done, and there is a good amount of emotion and happiness once Shepherd finally believes its really her husband reincarnated, but from there the film goes downhill. There are several sex-related scenes that turned me off completely, especially Downey and Shepherd wanting to get together again despite the difference in their age now. After that, however, the film manages to end in the most satisfying way possible, considering the circumstances of the plot. I was disappointed because I did not expect the film to become so immoral by the end. There was great potential with this story, and the scenes in heaven are well done. There is a good theme song sung by Peter Cetera and Cher, but ultimately the film is not great. For a better, similar film, try ""Heaven Can Wait."" Decent, but I really kind of wish I hadn't seen it because of the scenes in the second half.*** out of ****",positive,en,2

"We had an enjoyable experience here at Bacchanal. My husband was happy to find a good variety of cheese on the counter which included local and international selections. There were numerous seafood available on the counter which were fresh and nicely presented. The Mexican food station was also exciting. I saw the \""posole\"" and I was happy. Both the American and Asian food station did not fail to impress us. Those prime rib and korean bbq ribs were irresistable. Did I mention that the dessert station was mouth watering? Those lollipops were cute and lovely on the outside and tasty on my mouth. I also enjoyed those gelato and the toppings they have available. Tiramisu! What? Where? Yes on the dessert station next to many other yummy sweets.\n\nThe bright, modern and spacious decor of this place provided an enjoyable dining experience to us. I cant speak enough how much better this place is compared to the Wicked Spoon. Lucky for us that we came here on a Thursday thus we did not have to wait. The price was not cheap but definitely well worth it.",neutral,en,1
"We spent 4 nights here as a family of 4. The hotel was booked by our travel agent in the UK so having read the reviews I wasn't sure if I would have chosen the same hotel.
The hotel rooms are small. It was a tight fit for 4 of us particularly as there was no storage space for clothes or suitcases. The bathrom was small but adequate. The sink was very small and you risked bumping your head on the bathroom shelf when washing your face or wet shaving. Outside noise was obtrusive in our room. We could hear service vehicles (presumably for the Westfield shopping centre but possibly also for the hotel) very early in the morning (0500-0600).
The staff were very helpful. The rooms were cleaned efficiently. We had breakfast several days at the Cafe Venue which is part of the hotel building although you have to walk out of thr hotel and then enter via a different entrance. The cafe was always busy but the food was excellent.
The hotel is very convenient for the cable cars and also the street car to Fisherman's Wharf.
The gym is small but was always empty when I went in. There was a cross trainer, a cycling machine and a treadmill.
Wifi was free in all the rooms and worked well.
If you can deal with the street noise and don't mind having no space for your luggage then the hotel is absolutely fine.",negative,en,0

"I came here for dinner with Keri W. and Gardenia H. last year since we had heard really good things about this buffet. Located at The Cosmopolitan, this buffet took a lot of walking to find. And the line to get inside was ridiculous! But we persevered and waited for what seemed like forever before we were finally seated. I wanted to get to every single station and I almost did.\n\nFor my first plate, I tried:\n-- Tomato and Cucumber Salad: Light and refreshing.\n-- Bruschetta: I love bruschetta but was not a fan of the one here.\n-- Deli Meat and Crackers: Your typical meats with crackers; good but nothing special.\n-- Shrimp Cocktail: Just okay. The shrimp didn't taste very fresh.\n-- Shrimp Ceviche: Same here.\n-- Tomato Gazpacho: This was also just okay.\n\nI also got bread with garlic butter; I love my carbs!\n\nFor my second plate, I tried:\n-- BBQ Shrimp and Grits: These were actually pretty good. The grits not so much, but I do love shrimp.\n-- Fish and Chips: I could be biased since I don't like fish to begin with, but I didn't like the fish here. The chips were also just mediocre.\n\nMy third plate was also savoury food:\n-- Mashed Potatoes: Can't go wrong with this.\n-- Rotisserie Pork Shoulder: Not as tender as I wanted it to be.\n-- Chicken Pot Pie: Too watery for me.\n-- Angry Mac & Cheese: This was decent.\n-- Truffle Scalloped Potatoes: Not a lot of truffle flavour but I love my potatoes.\n-- Potato Plank \""Cowboy Bacon\"": Okay.\n\nFor my fourth plate, I got:\n-- Tomato Risotto: This was not very flavourful and I wished the risotto had been cooked more.\n-- Cheesy Bread: Exactly what the name is. Just okay.\n-- 5-Spice Pork Chop with Kimchi BBQ Sauce: I did not like this one at all. Don't do Korean food if you can't do it well :(\n-- Spicy Orange Chicken: I like the one at Panda Express better.\n-- Asiago Gnocchi: Forgettable. Literally. I don't remember even getting this.\n-- Vegetable Roll: Meh.\n-- Shrimp Tempura Roll: Just okay.\n-- Chilled Glazed Tofu: It was fine.\n\nFinally it was dessert time! I tried the following:\n-- Lemon Raspberry Cheesecake: I love cheesecake but I did not love this. Meh.\n-- Strawberry Shortcake: Meh.\n-- Red Velvet Cookie: I was so disappointed in this. I did not like it AT ALL and I usually love red velvet anything!\n-- Strawberry Cheesecake Bavarois: I really liked the meringue in this one. Probably my favourite dessert.\n-- Bread Pudding: Meh.\n-- Chocolate Covered Strawberry with Toffee: The strawberry wasn't as sweet naturally as I wished but this was good.\n-- Apple Streudel Tart: Decent but a little dry.\n-- Tiramisu: I didn't like this one :(\n-- Lemon Gelato: Light, refreshing, and a nice note to end the meal.\n\nAs you can see, I tried A LOT of the food here. And I found most of it to be pretty mediocre. They did do some things well, but not as well as I had hoped. I will admit that I came in here with high expectations and I was probably a victim of those. Granted, it does seem like this place does brunch better than they do dinner. But overall I was disappointed in the quality of the food here, especially considering their reputation and the price of the meal.",negative,en,0

"Awesome experience! My in-laws love this place and wanted us to try it. I have to say I didn't expect much after reading the reviews. We were cheerfully greeted at the door and seated immediately. My first impression was how beautiful the sunset looked through the panoramic windows. The decor has an 80's feel but in a good way. Chairs are cushioned - soft and comfortable but perfect for the tables. We even joked about buying similar ones for home. A large chandelier dominates the ceiling. Overall, the restaurant was warmly lit, clean and welcoming. \n\nMy In-laws said they hadn't seen children at the restaurant before and called ahead to see if my 14 month old daughter was welcome. And yes, the staff was fantastic with her. I'll think nearly every waitress stopped by to talk to her. One even read her a couple pages from a story book.\n\nOur service was great! The staff anticipated our needs by clearing plates and refilling drinks before we even realized we needed them. And I never felt like anyone was hovering over us. \n\nFood - again great! We started with calamari, which was the huge crowd favorite, and zuccinni. Both were good and huge. We had a table of 5 adults and the 2 apps were a little too much though you would never know it because we cleared the plates! We all ordered something different for an entree, and happily agreed that we would order the same again. \n\nAfterwards, the waitress took my left overs to the kitchen to wrap - rather than tossing me a box to do it myself. When I got home I noticed that she even covered the box with plastic wrap so it didn't spill in the car. \n\nA real class act!",positive,en,2

The chocolate chip pancakes were moist and fluffy and HUGE. For $8, I was expecting a much smaller portion. And the syrup that came with them was quite tasty. It was more than just a maple syrup.\n\nMy only complaint was the $12 bellinis. They weren't on the menu, so we didn't realize the price ahead of time. Very delicious. But we each had two... And we definitely weren't expecting them to cost more than the entrees. Not necessarily an unusual price for a drink in Vegas, but still.\n\nDrink prices aside, the atmosphere here is great.

"Tried it, and it was terrible. I lived in a country with a large Greek population and this was not really Greek food, more infused with American. I ordered the gyros platter as did the rest of the family. The pita bread was rubbery and plastic. The contents had absolutely no flavor and had no sauce inside. I have had gyros before and they have all been tasty and oozing with sauce. I usually eat anything, but this I did not eat, it was cold. Took the meat contents out and gave to the dogs when we got home. Rice was cooked to perfection but was bland and tasteless. Salad was good though. Service was friendly and quick, but that was because there was only a few people there, which is unusual for a Friday.",negative,en,0

"I went here last night for my birthday dinner, and I was extremely happy with the entire experience. The biggest plus for me, aside from the food that is, was the waitstaff. All of the servers were very friendly and professional, and I could tell they all looked out for each other. Case in point, I noticed some lint on one of my glasses of wine, and before I could even say anything, one of the other waiters saw me studying the glass and quickly came over and offered to replace it.\n\nSpeaking of wine, the selection was great, but I was unfortunately relegated to the limited \""wine by the glass\"" menu since I was the only red wine drinker at my table. Even so, the selection of wine by the glass was well-rounded and pretty solid, and our waiter's wine recommendations were spot on. Now, for the food!\n\nBread and olive oil is complimentary, of course, and very tasty (so simple...but so good!). For starters, we ordered the crab cakes as well as a spring salad with walnuts and gorgonzola, both of which were very good. For my entree, I had the roast duck, which came with fingerling potatoes, red cabbage, spring vegetables. The entire dish was fantastic. Moist duck, perfectly cooked vegetables, and a wonderful sauce that had blueberries in it. A simple dish done very, very well.\n\nIn all, Timpone's is a great place for a gourmet meal at a pretty decent price. They have a nice selection of veg-friendly dishes, too (not vegan, however).

"Ok...so I am not a big Mexican food fan generally. I love the idea of it; the big margaritas, always a fun time, but the greasy food usually leaves me not feeling too good after. This is not the case at Los Sombreros!!! \n\nThe atmosphere is sooooo great -- an old house thats been redone with a great porch and fantastic big outdoor bar. For food I got the mango crab salad which was amazing!!! Light and refreshing, but incredible flavor. We also had an awesome watermelon salad and my date had a pork dish that was really good too. His portion was so big but not overly creasy or heavy...just too much. Mine was the perfect light meal even though the waitress said it was small; thus they probably are accustomed to big portions. \n\nThis is not your typical mexican fare. Everything was very fresh and not too greasy. The sangria was good and the margaritas were pretty good as well, although not fantastic. Over all a winner!!

"This place was really good. Randomly went here with some friends and I'll definitely be returning.\n\nI had a 3 piece combo (catfish & whiting) with shrimp, fries and hush puppies.

I didn't make it to the hush puppies, that was the only thing that didn't look appetizing. I did try some fried okra, that was really good too.\n\nThe fried fish and seafood are really good. This place is relatively cheap. For $10 I don't know if there is a better option in Arizona. Definitely the best fried seafood I've had in Arizona.\n\nThis place is not in the best location, it's behind the light rail but it's worth finding.",neutral,en,1

"I read good reviews about this ""boutique"" hotel prior to booking it during for 2 nights in November, 2006. I can only describe my experience as Bad and Ugly. My room, although described as a suite, was really an old, fairly dirty, small room with a 1950 kitchen and bath. The air conditioning did not work, the shower was slow, and the room was dark and musty. In short, the accommodations were grim.
Their ""business center"" is a small desk top computer on a very small desk with a printer underneath. It is located in the basement hallway and you must insert a credit card to get onto the internet. I paid an additional $5 for printing 3 pagers.
Service is poor and the front of the street is all torn up. I did not experience the restaurant - I was afraid of what I would get - but if it is anything like the hotel, it must alo be bad.

TV's lined the bar for sports and each booth is lined up against the wall so the TV screens are also in view of each person in the place. The female bartender was amazingly knowledgeable and led us down the right path. We orderd the wonderful asparagus with goat cheese, the WINGS were absolutely delcious with no single flavor that overpowered another, very good non-traditiona wings. The sweet and spicy burger was amazingly tasty, but again, excellent blend of flavors, nothing too strong, very creative. The peppercorn burger was also excellent, however the cheeseburger was rather uneventful, but it's also a 'cheeseburger\"" with no added love. We left this place 100 percent satisfied and excited for the next taste test. If you look at all of my reviews, I most always stop short of giving 5 stars, it was without a doubt on this one that give 5 stars.

"We had dinner here tonight for the first time. After reading several reviews in the paper about Liberty Market, and being fans of Joe's Farm Grill and Real BBQ, we were determined to get in here. We parked in the back and as we walked along the sidewalk next to Liberty Market we noticed the long line trailing out of Joe's Real BBQ and then noticed the crowd inside Liberty Market. I was instantly impressed that someone can be so successful in today's shaky market and open restaurant after restaurant with business just booming.\n\nAs we walked in we noticed that there was a line in which you stand to order your food at a counter. We joined the line and read the menu. Already having decided on a margherita pizza, we also chose the caprese salad and I knew I wanted a glass of pinot noir. As we stood, I noticed that there were very few empty tables and I mentioned to my husband that maybe I should snag a table. I had my eye on one table but as I walked toward it someone else apparently also had their eye on it and sat there first. I bolted over to the only other empty table that I saw. I sat for several minutes, watching my husband inch his way up to the counter. A manager lady came over to me and asked me if I had someone standing in line. I said yes. She informed me that they usually like people to all wait in line and then order before sitting at a table. I looked back at her and thought about the fact that there were no empty tables. I said okay, but I held on to my table. So that part was a little stressful. The couple next to me joked around saying that I wasn't following the rules and may end up getting kicked out of my table. Thankfully my husband was finally able to order and made his way over to our table.\n\nWe sat close to several other tables which seemd to invite conversation from all sides. We chatted with all the people around us which was fun.\n\nOur food came and it was delicious! The pizza was perfectly cruncy and chewy. The caprese salad was very tasty. We devoured every last bite.\n\nOn our way out we were lucky to see Joe, the owner, and were able to compliment him on his wonderful restaurant. I'll definitely be back to try something else!",neutral,en,1

"I've only been once but I'm a big fan. This space is quite nice. My indoctrination to The Venue happened this weekend during the Scottsdale Spice Culinary Event. Tons of people meandered about as we nibbled on food and drink, listening/watching/dancing to a band. Good times were had and we never felt over crowded. \n\nThe old school style of the building, with dark accent wood paneling and incredibly large chandeliers, offered a non-generic experience. The main bar wraps around and is rather large, providing plenty of access to the bartenders. The secondary bar is made for tall people (not the shorties who can't be seen in a crowd, desperately waving a drink ticket). Still great for those over 5'3\"". \n\nThe acoustics were phenomenal. I scored parking immediately around the corner so I can't comment on how challenging it might be to find something. (And no, I'm not giving away my new secret.) \n\nI'd highly recommend this place to attend a music event and to host a private event.

Served with fries that were hot and crisp.\n\nThey have live music on some evenings. It was loud. Fortunately, they started up when my friend and I were done eating, so we gave them a walking ovation. The rest of the meal was nice and quiet.",neutral,en,1

"We had to visit Seattle for a day and decided to stay here since we found a last minute deal for $128 on hotels.com. Ye hotel is ok. Got there late night had a smooth check. The guy at the seat was on the phone and we had to wait for couple of minutes before we were helped. Got the wifi for $5. Room was ok. 2 double beds and a microwave.
In the morning the problem started. My wife was getting ready in the washroom and all if a sudden there was a heavy leakage from the ceiling and she was drenched in water. The worst part is that she heard the toilet flush from the room above us before the leakage. I called the help desk and lady said they are sending some one. No one came for the next half an hour until we decided to leave and check out. I told the guy at the reception and he acted as if this was very normal. He said he will have it checked and thats it.

"We stayed at Radisson Martinique for a week in the beginning of March 2012. The location of the hotel is fantastic for a first time visitor - in the middle of everything. The subway outside of the frontdoor gives you access to the city from your doorstep. Decent restaurants in the neighborhood. If you are a fan of Korean food you'll be in heaven, since the hotel is located at Korea Street. You have Empire state building in the same block. A lot of places serves breakfast in the area.
We had a room on the 17th floor which was big and with no traffic noice, though the heater/AC in our room made a terrible noice. No view to talk about since the windows were small - but it didn't matter to us. The room and bathroom were clean and the amenities were of good quality.
The personnel gives you a feeling that they would be better off without guests. There were some positive exceptions like the cleaning staff and a couple of the reception staff. As an example: My wife tried to in secret of me order a room service breakfast and was talking to the personell and there was no possibility to arrange that beforehand - you had to put the breakfasts order on the doorhandle of the room - which was impossible without spoiling the surprice. The champagne was out of the question due to legal issues ;-). The lack of flexibility is total - this might be a managerial issue or a cultural one - we don't really know.

"I've read a few books about Bonnie and Clyde, and this is definitely MORE accurate than the Beatty/Dunaway version, in that its costumes and locales echo actual photographs taken of the gang. Particularly well done is the death of Buck Barrow, and the capture of his wife Blanche. This actress looks looks exactly like the photographs taken that day of Blanche grieving over her dying husband. However, this movie is still Hollywood, and our anti-heroes stay pretty to the end, even after being shot full of holes (in life, Bonnie was badly burned in an auto accident the year before their famous ambush, and did not look like a perky cheerleader at the time of her death). The script is tedious, and the acting is poor, particularly the leads. Very disappointing. Stick with Beatty and Dunaway. Their's may not be ""the true story,"" but it's a great film.",negative,en,0

We were hoping for one of the renovated rooms, but no luck. My only complaint was the surly staff. The concierge was humorless and seemed annoyed any time we had a question. It got the point that we went to the bell captain for information, which he gladly gave us. We seemed to get the same waiter every time we were in the bar, and he also seemed very put out when we wanted anything. It took an hour to get a toothbrush delivered to the room for one of our group whose luggage was delayed (had to call front desk three times).

"I've been to the Tempe Improv many times, maybe more than I should fess up to, lol. It's always a great time! Purchase your tickets on-line & arrive at least 1 to 1 1/2 hours before your show time.

You need to be prepared to sit in close proximity to others, in other words, if you're a \""respect the bubble\"" type of person, you might want to rethink your choice. If you're with a large group you all need to purchase your tickets together so that you're seated together, or call the box office to see what they can do. The menu has been simplified, there's not much to choose from, but the food is decent & counts towards your 2 item requirement. If you're easily offended you can check out their Sideshow Cafe (I think that's what it's called) were the comedy is appropriate for all ages.

"I visited the W Seattle for a weekend stay prior to a conference. I've always enjoyed my stays at W Hotels, and the W Seattle upheld this tradition.
Arrived via the Light Link Train from the Sea-Tac airport. This has an easy commute and a great bargain for only $2.50 fare per person. The University station is only one block from the W hotel entrance.
If you like the vibe of the W Hotels, you'll enjoy a stay here. The Seattle W is one of the more 'subdued' of the W family, but it's still very much a W - lots of great architecure near the hotel. Seattle Library (amazing modern design) and the grand Olympic hotel on the opposite side. The W building itself is a striking building, bands of dark glass alternating with white facade of the building - topped with a metal mesh pyramid on the roof - very easy to spot from all over the city.
I arrived at the hotel around 2:30 and was greeted by a lovely and professional young woman at the Welcome Desk. She graciously upgraded me to a 'spectacular' room, which are found on the higher floors (for a better view). The lobby was lovely - nice earth tone funiture, an inviting fireplace, with soaring ceilings.
My room was on the 15th floor, facing 4th street and Elliott Bay water view. The style of the rooms and corridors was consistent with other W's - hip, modern style with an aura of cool luxury. Room was quite spacious, spotlessly clean and everything was in perfect working order. I particularly loved the sofa seat in the window. I could sit there and relax while enjoying the city view. A/C -ventilation worked well. I never heard any noise from others in the hotel. The W bed is decadant - couldn't wait to get into the bed each nice - loved the sheets and the pillows! The bathroom was very large - the towels, bathrobe, and toileties were so luxurious.
Used the Sweat Fitness Center two times - wonderful facility with top-notch equipment and super-clean.
Took advantage of the free Wheels service for a ride to the Olympic Sculpture park - awesome ride and very professional service.
Room was serviced very well and timely.
Ate at the hotel's restaraunt - Earth & Ocean for one dinner and both breakfasts - it was awesome. The duck and charcuterie plates were fabulous - provided the best dinner that I had for my entire Seattle trip. The adjacent bar had a nice happy hour in the late afternoon and again in the late evening - awesome drinks - loved the lemon drop in particular.
Only negatives that come to mind are rather insignificant:
I could never find the concierge at the desk in the Living Room - I didn't really need his/her services, but it would have been nice to get a city walking map. Also, the Acura service closed at 5:00p.m., it would have been nice to have it as an option for transport to evening activities.

"I stayed at the Days Inn for 2 nights and could not wait to move out. I arrived in the evening. Others were trying to check in as well. I stood there for almost 45 minutes until I was checked in. Once, checked in, they had given me a room that had not been cleaned. The problem was they had not other rooms to check me into due to overbooking. I had to wait another 20 minutes while they tried to figure something out for me.
The room I ended up with was dark and dirty--it looked nothing like the pretty photos online. The furniture was worn and chipped. The carpet and blankets were stained and just plain filthy. I felt so uncomfortable staying there and would have checked out if I could have found a different hotel nearby that had rooms open.
One of the other guests I spoke to in the lobby told me that her family had been checked into a room and the staff at the hotel checked another guest into the same room. Their belonging had been gone through and items were stolen. When confronted, the second guest disappeared.
I HAVE NEVER EXPERIENCED THIS LEVEL OF INCOMPETENCE AT A HOTEL. I wrote to Days Inn but did not receive a response.",negative,en,0

"Shut your face. Yup. You. Because I just can not believe, I have waited so long to come here!\n\nWhat have I been doing with my life? Now, to be honest, this was our first stop of the evening. So we had drinks and an appetizer. Big mistake, I will tell you why later. \n\nWe were there during Happy Hour and happily, the Paloma was on the menu. The Paloma is by go to drink and they did it well. Tequila, lime juice and grapefruit juice. Yum. Trust me, people can mess up this simple libation. My husband ordered a Manhattan. Delicious. Just fantastic. Sweet but it packed a nice bite. I wish I had ordered one myself. \n\nWe also ordered the buffalo cheese curds. They are the traditional cheese curds douses in buffalo sauce (kind of like a chicken wing). They were amazing. Completely different concept than I was used to. I could only eat a few before my mouth were on fire. I wish they had given us more dressing (or a larger cup) to cover the curd more. They were so unique. The traditional order is perfect for 3-4 people. With two people, it was extremely filling. The bottom ones that were sitting in the sauce got a little soggy. I wish they did not have a pool of the sauce at the bottom. Yeah, yeah, little things. But I have nothing else to critique. \n\nI liked the way our table was tucked against a pillar. They had a couple of two tops that just float in the middle of the floor. Those were kind of weird. I would NOT want to sit there. The decor and overall feeling was fantastic. The value was fantastic as well. Two delicious (and large) cocktails with the appetizer was $20 even. Not sure why I was not convinced it was a 5. Just might have to go back and try some more. \n\nSo the big mistake was leaving. We were heading to Graze for an entree round of part of a progressive dinner. We should have never left Merchant. It was fantastic!",neutral,en,1

"Jump Rope Scuffing after 10 minutes + UPDATE
FOLLOW UP FEEDBACK: I added a star (3 to 4) due to my satisfaction with owners Eric and Helen who responded to my review immediately, and offered to replace my jump rope which I accepted. My new jump rope arrived within 2 days. Additional Note: I would recommend this jump rope for indoors. My experience was on concrete (rough surface at a park) not over a smooth surface. The primary reason for increasing the rating one Star was due to the prompt reply and fast delivery. ORIGINAL FEEDBACK: I bought this jump rope exclusively because I read it is also for concrete. I do not have anywhere I can jump indoors. I understand that over time this will wear, however it began scuffing after only 10 min. of jumping. I am hoping Fitness Factor will respond on one of my posts because I just bought this rope and only used it 2x. I would like Fitness Factor to send me beads (as they mentioned in another review), since I do not want to spend any more money. For me, $14 is more than my budget allows for.

"Great atmosphere, awesome view, decent food, pricey. I took some customers out to Eiffel Tower last week and had a good time. The decor was beautiful yet subdued (as a French joint should be). You have to go up an elevator several floors - the result is one of the best views of the Strip. It's great just to look out through the glass at all the lights and buildings. If you're seated well, you can even catch the Bellagio water show from your table.\n\nFoodwise, I think it was good, but not awesome. For a French place, the French bread was meh - you can do better at the grocery store. My foie gras was excellent though. I think it scared off a couple of my customers haha. My rack of lamb entree was pretty tasty, though it was a little hard to cut. \n\nBeing a Chicago foodie (hmm that probably sounded pretentious haha), Vegas restaurants don't automatically knock your socks off. There are lots of great Chicago restaurants to compare (and several of them, like N9ne and Japonais, also opened up shop in Vegas). Eiffel Tower definitely wasn't 5-star quality. I would probably be even harder on it if I wasn't on an expense account. But hey, it's Vegas, so you are expected to pay a lot for everything, right? :) The view , though, is very unique and adds to a fine dining experience.",neutral,en,1

"i usually don't review starbucks because they're generally all the same.\n\nthis one was just not up to their brand standards, though. you can see on other reviews some of the issues i will mention here.\n\nstaff wasn't very friendly upon arrival. i ordered a hot beverage in the middle of a hot summer day. yes, i know what i ordered. why are you questioning me?

"I came home from work the other day and I found a pamphlet hanging on my door from a new local restaurant called \""The Tasty House\""\n\nTheir menu is very impressive. They have a very large selection on there all separated into appropriate categories which make it easy to read. \""Chicken\"" \""Chow-Mein and Lo-Mein, Seafood\"" etc. As I browsed the menu and looked over at the prices, I really was interested...but alas, the Tasty House would have to wait.\n\nSeveral weeks later and a lot of convincing later -- I finally managed to visit the Tasty House on a warm Saturday afternoon (11/6/2010) for lunch and here are my impressions:\n\nLocation:\nFrom where *I* live, the location is perfect. Located in the \""hole-in-the-wall\"" area of around 15th Ave. and Bell Rd. it's only about 5 minutes from my house, but I digress. The Tasty House really is a small hole in the wall business. I really enjoy these types of places and my wife and I secretly search for these \""gems\"" and try desperately to discover something we can rave about and enjoy eating for years to come.\n\nInterior / Ambiance:\nThis leaves a little bit to be desired. But...understandably. You don't look at a menu and see an entire pint of egg flower soup for $2.50 and expect the interior to be \""top notch\"" -- and I will level with everyone when I say it's kind of a dive. The chairs and tables are very beautiful and brand new, but the walls, ceiling, floor, and ambiance is that of an old beat down used up building with some generic Chinese wall-hangs attempting to give some decor to the otherwise plain walls. Hopefully they can make some money and they can spice it up -- it could really be a delicious intimate restaurant.\n\nThe Service:\nHere is where they got knocked an entire star. Don't get me wrong: I appreciate that people could be at work tired, maybe they are not feeling well, maybe they are just having a \""Bad Day\"" but my wife and I are an up-beat young couple and we walked into the Tasty House with high hopes to get some delicious Chinese food....\n\nWe were not greeted. No one said Hello. In fact, let me paint a picture of what we saw: Nothing. The entire place looked empty, except for a teenage Chinese boy who had on a pair of headphones and looked like he was actually sleeping in the corner while reading the paper. Our guess is that he was a delivery guy and he had no orders so he was resting. Sounds fine to us.\n\nAfter a few minutes the beautiful young girl came to greet us and take our order. Rather than try and re-create her attitude via text in a written review, I will simply say that she was NOT happy to be there, and she did not seem happy serving us or taking our order. That's all I will say -- she could have smiled, once, or at least been happy to give us our food or *something* -- I actually felt BAD for her. I wanted to help her, like maybe she was ringing people up under gunpoint or she was secretly some type of a waitress hostage. We didn't really tip, but it wasn't really a \""wait on us\"" situation...\n\nThe Food:\nThe food was amazing. I ordered the spicy Szechuan chicken with steamed rice and an egg roll. My wife ordered the sesame chicken with steamed rice and an egg roll. We both drank water so it only cost us $10.88 -- seriously. For lunch. In Phoenix. VERY good value.\n\nAfter a few moments the unhappy girl delivered to our table the most delicious spicy chicken szechuan piled high with delicious crisp vegetables. I loved every bite. The Egg roll was nuclear hot and went well with the complimentary sweet and sour sauce and duck sauce.\n\nMy wife's Sesame chicken was also very delicious -- although she says it had too much sauce on it, but she tends to like things bland. It had a great mix of savory and sweet delicious flavor and seemed perfect to me.\n\n\nThe Price:\n$10.88 for two people for lunch is great, especially with the portions and how delicious is was. Well worth it, and I highly recommend it to people for lunch or even dinner (dinner prices are about 2-6 more, depending on what you order)... so you could get out of there for probably $14-18 for dinner.\n\n\nThe Verdict: \nI would definitely give Tasty House another try. The food was good enough and delicious and the price was right for me to investigate this as another option. My only change: I am going to do Take Out so I just have to pick it up, pay,and go home to eat it.",negative,en,0

"This is a great game! Okay perhaps it didn't have some of the features it was meant to have but Digital Anvil have still come up with a good game. There is a certain similarity to Elite(you can trade, pick up weapons and cargo off destroyed ships, go on missions)however this game features a heavily scripted mission. It is a great mission. The control system is different it uses the mouse! You basically fly you spaceship around a system and work your way up! The game features some pretty good graphics even through it was made in 2003. It should run well on even a modestly specified PC. The story features some great voice acting from John Rhys Davies, George Takei, Jennifer Hale(she appears in every computer game). Stick with the story it gets better and better as it goes on. There is even a race section, where you and an opponent have to race your spaceships around a course(it involves you going through rings). This section took me a while to beat. It adds variety to the game. Some sections are a little tough here and there but overall you can beat this game. The game has an active mod scene on the Net. Pick up some mods to extend the game. I haven't played any of the mods yet. Sadly a sequel to this was cancelled, a shame!",positive,en,2

($6). All three were covered with shredded lettuce and bits of cheese, and there was a nice sauce floating around on the plate underneath.\n\nThe serving of chips for the three of us was dinky (even though we were brought a few more later), & they were paper thin. The rest of the food was very good, so it's a high 3 Stars overall for this nice place. :-)\n\n(Cash only.)",negative,en,0

I dove in head first with my friend last night, and it was none too shabby. \n\nFirst, let me say that they are definitely paying attention to their reviews on Yelp because the service was spot on. It was fast, friendly, and the manager came over to see how we were doing. A-OK in my book!\n\nI ordered turkey meatballs with pesto, and melted the cheese on top.

But saying that they come with french bread when they literally come with one piece of crostini is not cool. $3.50 for a soda, absurd! $1.50 for cheese on top of the meatballs, mmmno. And finally, $7 for a side of garlic parmesan fries? I want fries dipped in golden ketchup for that price.

"Like all W hotels, the focus is on customer service and hip style, and this hotel delivers 100% in those areas. I have several issues with the design on the rooms, however.
First, to turn on any light in the room the ""master switch"" near the door must be on, this switch also controls the primary light in the room, so it is not possible, for example, to get up in the middle of the night and turn on just the bathroom light in an effort to not disturb your spouse.
Second, the sink and shower area is seperated from the bedroom portion of the room, not by a wall, but by a mesh screen which can be seen through if the lights in the bathroom are on. If you were sharing the room with your children, the only way to get privacy while taking a shower would be to make them hang out in the lobby. The mesh screen also makes the shower area very drafty and seems to be one of those things that must have seemed like a good idea to the interior designer, but doesn't function in the real world.
Third, the hotel is in the theater district and there are neon lights everywhere, so to get the room dark at night it is important to be able to close the shades complete, which is very difficult to do because the windows are approximately 12 feet high and there is no rod attached to the curtains, so you just have to try to tug them into place the best you can. I ended up using the ironing board to trap them closed.
Otherwise, this hotel is in a great location, surrounded by good food and plenty of things to do.",negative,en,0

"I'm a Hilton Honors member so I pretty much stay at Hilton properties all the time. I stayed at the Hilton San Antonio Airport due to it's proximity to the airport, which pretty much was its only redeeming quality.
- The key card I received when I checked in didn't work. Obviously not a major issue but just a frustration over something easy they should not get wrong.
- The check-in attended assured me the room was setup as requested. It was not.
- The room itself was in disrepair: mold in the shower, paint bubbled up and peeling/falling off the ceiling; a dead bug (looked like a cricket) in the corner behind the door; rust and a hole where the door-stop is; the shower head was not attached to the wall where the water pipe came out; etc.

"Running errands near Camelback a few Fridays ago, I found myself STARVING, yet having several more stops on my itinerary. The Yelp application on my iPhone (insert shameless plug here) showed that Harvey's was right around the corner, and with a swing of the wheel, I was pulling up to their dilapidated storefront. \n\nBeing alone, I bellied up to the bar, which was packed at 2:00 PM on a Friday. I still had work to get done that afternoon, so I had to stick with an RC Cola (yes, you read that correctly.....RC Cola). Let me just tell you that I was the only person in the place that didn't have a beer in hand. Happy hour (and the weekend, apparently) had arrived early at Harvey's. \n\nJust a quick moment on the very eclectic crowd that filled this place. On my left were two appliance repairmen. On my right was a gentlemen that was pushing 80. At the pool tables were a group of what looked like college kids. Their common bond was the beer they were all putting away. I immediately made plans to return on a coming Friday afternoon, with friends in tow, and be a part of this very diverse, day drinking crowd. \n\nNow, onto the food, which is why I stopped by in the first place. I wasn't sure what a \""wineburger\"" is and I can't fully say that, even now, I understand. All I know is that I ordered their standard wineburger and that it was grilled fresh for me, right at the bar. \n\nThe burger took about 15 minutes to cook and I could pretty much watch them prepare it. The same person that took my order (and delivered beers to all my fellow patrons) prepped and cooked the burger. It was fresh ground meet, pressed into a patty and they regularly pressed it into the grill with her spatula. Ultimately, it was served up on a fresh bun, which crisp lettuce, onions pickles, and melting cheese. \n\nLet me tell you that this burger was FRESH. Grease was still dripping off the sides of it. There were cracks in the edge of the burger, where they had been pressing it down into the grill. I actually had to wait a couple of minutes to eat it, as it was still TOO hot. I'm not sure of where you're going to go and get a burger that is cooked that fresh, right in front of you, and then immediately handed to you. Probably one of the freshest hamburgers that I've ever had prepared (in which I wasn't actually grilling it myself). \n\nThe onion rings were straight out of the boiling oil and too hot to eat. (I'm sure my doctor does not approve of this meal). All the condiments I could ask for were delivered promptly. The burger was hot, with just the right amount of grease, and full of flavor. This was as close to home-made as you can get.",neutral,en,1

"I travel with my dog while doing dog park assessments for DogParksUSA ( <url> and we stay in hotels together during these trips. I have spent the past two nights in the La Quinta at 9125 Gateway West in El Paso. All of the La Quintas, with the exception of three, permit dogs without any pet deposit.
Dog owners are typically placed on the ground floor here, as was I during this stay. They are typically placed in the back section that overlooks the dumpster (ugh). There is no dog walk area; one might try walking one's dog along the gravel under the bushes in the back, but my dog was totally not interested in doing business there. I ended up having to walk her quite aways to get to someplace that had something resembling grass. Many of the sidewalks around this La Quinta have broken glass all over them, making walking barefooted dogs a hazard.
There are about 8 La Quintas in El Paso, all of which seem to be off of I-40, as is this one. Gateway is the frontage road that runs along both sides of I-40. This location was located next to some non-chain restaurants, including Andale (didn't try it; says ""Great Food, Great Fun"") and Chih-ua Tacos y Cortes (didn't try it, either), and Oriental Imports Food & Gifts (didn't try this one either). Of interest, and a tad creepy, is the location immediately behind the hotel of the Foxy All-Nude (opens at 12Noon and closes at 4AM) and conveniently located next door SOSEXXY Lingerie-Dancewear-Costumes. However, about a block away is a local supermarket chain called Big 8, the national Dollar General chain, a Wing Stop, and across the street from there is a shopping center with a chinese buffet, a Dollar Tree, a Best Buy, a CompUSA, a Taco Bell, and a used clothing shop (classier than the usual thrift shop -- I bought some nice, affordable stuff there) called Platos' Closet (part of a chain of 300 stores).
Now for the room -- it was nicely equipped with a very comfortable king bed, dresser with 36 or 42 inch HDTV (and all HDTV channels, including tons of sports and Showtime channels) a mini fridge and a microwave. There is an ironing board and iron in the closet, a coffeemaker and a hair dryer in the bathroom. The fridge did not work too well (the freezer seemed like it was defrosting -- I kept finding water dripping into the fridge department, yet soda in the fridge department was partially frozen) and the microwave was a very low end model -- my issue was with the two baby roaches that came out from under the microwave (which is bolted to the top of the fridge). Since it is locked down so hotel guests won't steal a cheap microwave that they could buy at any kMart for $39, I imagine housekeeping cannot clean under there like they should, making it a desirable home for undesirable critters. Hmm. Other than that unwelcome guest thing, I didn't mind the room. But the room location was a problem. It was located right behind the laundry facility for housekeeping. The washers start running around 9AM and the dryers continue tumbling until around early evening. I could feel the vibrations through the wall of my room during the spin cycles of the washers and the tumble cycles of the dryers. Fortunately, I did not need to sleep late or take a nap in the afternoon. If you don't want to be next to the laundry room, you will not want to be booked into these room numbers: 115 - 118, and 215 - 218., The hotel has two floors and no elevators, so those who have mobility issues or a lot of stuff to bring into their room will not want to be on the second floor. There is a small swimming pool in the front of the hotel with a scenic view of I-40 -- and a mountain or two far off. There is free wi-fi for guests. There is a free continental breakfast in the lobby for guests.
If I were to travel to El Paso again with my dog, I would not stay here. I probably would not stay here by myself, either, because, while I did not witness any unsavory activity from the Foxy All-Nude, I just don't like to be close to places like that. There are plenty of other La Quintas in El Paso to stay at.

"This is a wonderful new movie currently still showing in cinemas in my country. Its director, the Calabrian Gianni Amelio, is in my humble view perhaps the only contemporary Italian director, along with Nanni Moretti, to deserve being called great (that is, apart from the old masters who're still around and occasionally still churning out movies). It's one of my greatest regrets that contemporary Italian cinema has been ailing since the mid-70s, mostly due to a dire lack of funding and nurturing of new talent, something which can be transferred to most fields and which makes Italy one of the most static industrialised countries of our time production-wise (both in an industrial and cultural sense)... unlike, say, China. And this, among other things, is precisely the subject of Amelio's latest movie. Few directors can speak to me about the true, present state of my country and the world as Amelio can, yet his pictures also have a precious timelessness and universality. And for those already worrying that they may be slow, ponderous and worthy - rest assured: of the ones I've seen they most certainly aren't, at least not if you're used to quality European cinema.The basic plot outline: Vincenzo Buonavolontà is a technician at an obsolete steel plant factory somewhere in Italy, probably the North. He is played by Sergio Castellitto, one of contemporary Italy's most versatile and talented actors. When a major Chinese steel company purchases some of the Italian steel plant's industrial machinery, Vincenzo, who struggles to make himself understood with the non-Italian speaking Chinese director, tries to tell him that the machine is defective and its converter needs substituting, an element he's working on custom-building himself. He warns them that not doing this might have very dangerous consequences. Meanwhile a young Chinese woman called Liu Hua acts as interpreter between the two men, but seems to struggle to find adequate translations for some of Vincenzo's technical jargon. The Italian eventually loses his patience with her, virtually pushing her aside and asking her to hand him the Chinese-Italian dictionary so that he can do the translating himself.Despite Vincenzo's warnings, the following morning he finds that the Chinese factory director and his employees have returned to their own country while not heeding his advice about the adequate use of the industrial machine at all. Thus Vincenzo, equipped with his great integrity, sets off for China. And here begins an endlessly fascinating road movie through China, a very topical 21st century Odyssey through the Asian Giant. A latter-day Marco Polo's quest for the secrets of the mysterious nation? Not quite. As in all of Amelio's movies, the journey itself becomes far more important than whether its ultimate ""mission"" is carried out or not. In fact, the way in which the point is literally brought home, not without a touch of humour, is a lovely, poignant paradox and irony, which made my eyes well up while I was simultaneously smiling. The spectator is let in on the secret that Vincenzo's trip was ultimately completely useless, but he himself doesn't know it, and goes home a satisfied man, a deluded innocent. At least, you figure, he's happy. Sort of.The journeys that Amelio's characters embark on totally uproots and strips them down to their bare, human essentials. They are momentarily without name, status or someone to put in a word for them. These Theo Angelopoulos-like themes are also explored in Lamerica, actually my favourite Amelio movie, closely followed by La stella che non c'è in order of personal preference. In the 1994 movie Lamerica, two Italian racketeers travel to Albania to ""do business"". Just like Vincenzo, they intend to go there, do what they have to do and then go back home. Instead, one of these two Italians accidentally ends up on an almost Homeric journey through this devastated land just after the fall of Communism.But let us go back to La stella che non c'è: once Vincenzo is in China, he predictably discovers that the seemingly ""simple"" task of handing the converter to its new owner is anything but straight-forward. The piece of machinery's new location is seemingly almost impossible to determine, unless he embarks on an arduous journey through China. When he comes across Liu Hua, the young interpreter he'd mistreated now working as a librarian, he tries to speak to her but she reacts in a hostile manner, informing him that because of him, she'd lost her job as interpreter back in Italy. Played by the relative newcomer Ling Tai, Liu Hua soon becomes a Virgil to Vincenzo's Dante when she grudgingly figures that she could do worse than to act as guide and interpreter for the Italian on his trip (obviously for a consistent sum of cash). This young Chinese actress may not have the beauty of Ziyi Zhang, nor the movie star glamour of Gong Li, but her charming, expressive and pretty face oozes a combination of defiant strength, intelligence, dignity and wry humour that'll make her features difficult to forget once you've seen the movie. Furthermore, she and Castellitto have wonderful emotional chemistry as co-stars.Amelio weaves dramas that are serious, poetic, mythical, post-neo-realist and humorous all at once, while maintaining a heart-warming ability to explore the fleeting essence of humanity in everyday, commonplace circumstances. A documentary-like naturalness conceals what is actually a meticulously conceived tapestry of faces and places, a vista which also manages to incorporate a cinematography of breath-taking beauty. The photography here is functional yet gorgeous, as befits a movie on the displaced in an industrial and emotional wasteland.Amelio's observant eye is a grown-up, disillusioned one, yet also never a cynical or misanthropic one. The masterful camera angles also often gives a sense of Vincenzo's alienness in the eyes of the Chinese, bringing home a sense of objectivity and cultural impartiality that's very rare in movies about a ""familiar"" Westerner exploring an ""unfamiliar"" non-Western country. I cannot recommend this movie enough.",positive,en,2

"Every two months, my husband and I stay at this hotel after his oncology check-ups. (We made a commitment to make something pleasant out of something unpleasant.) The staffers at this hotel never fail to impress us with their level of service. This time, the New York Giants were staying in the hotel, and aside from the black draperies hanging in the lobby to give them privacy, you would have never known there were people more important than us in the building! The staffers were very discreet, saying only that there was ""a group who wanted privacy."" (Guests could go behind the curtains to board the elevators to their rooms with no problem. I was lucky enough to meet some of the Giants on the elevator--that's how I found out they were there!) Despite the VIPs in residence, our $80 room was ready early, we were greeted warmly, etc. The breakfast was fresh and hot, and the hotel was quiet.

"We parked at the Petco field parking structure ($16/day) around the corner because the hotel charges $40/NIGHT to park there. At check in, the front desk agent asked what music we wanted playing when we got to the room. it would have been really cool if when we'd got to the room there was actually music playing, but there wasn't. The TV got messed up every time we connected our iPod to the a/v cables at the TV/media center. Basically we could never watch TV. The room speakers sucked, which was hard to believe considering we were at the HARD ROCK. Rooms are poorly designed, from the bed edges that you scrape your leg on, to the bathroom door that slams your fingers if you hold it while closing, to the shower door that has no handle on the inside so it's hard to close. It's a constant balancing act of stuff not to fall down or readjusting.
The pool area is relaxing, if you can get one of the little couches.The pool is miniscule and basically everyone just stands in it for many hours at a time. You do the math. The hot tub was ok but after 8 people were in it, it got crowded.The bouncers at the club are snotty, but the lady at the pool lounge entrance was really nice. you get in free to the clubs from 9-10 if you're staying at the hotel. Make sure guys are not wearing flip-flops because they will NOT get in. we stayed for about 30 minutes and left...pretty boring. DJ sucked and the drinks were outrageously expensive. the location is great for walking the gaslamp. That's about the best I can say for this place. Stay at the Hotel Solamar instead. It's a LOT cheaper, rooms are bigger, beds more comfortable and the staff is fantastic.",negative,en,0

Christy and her staff at Phoenix Cake Company made our Cake for our Wedding. My husband and I interview several other companies which either couldn't do exactly what we envision or were way too expensive. The venue we were using suggested we try their preferred vendor which is Phoenix Cake Company. We should have done this first. The cake turned out amazingly gorgeous and exactly what we envision and absolutely delicious. They have several different flavors and combinations to choose from. Our guests were amazed at how beautiful this cake was and it's flavors. There was even a last minute issue with our cake topper which Christy quickly resolved and notified us with a solution. We will continue to use them for our upcoming events and highly recommend this company for any event requiring any type of cake,positive,en,2

"Starring: Jim Carrey, Morgan Freeman, Jennifer Anniston I was really quite skeptical the first time I watched this movie. I mean, what a conceptual NIGHTMARE. Jim Carrey playing God? Nothing is sacred anymore.Well, this movie is hardly sacred, but it also is not sacrilegious, at least not to any great extent. Yes, Jim Carrey has the powers of God for a while, but he is not God. Confused? I'll give you the low down.Jim Carrey plays Bruce Nolan, a reporter who is down on his luck and feeling very unsuccessful with his life. He lives with his beautiful girlfriend, Grace (Anniston), and you can tell right off the bat that they love each other, but the relationship is on fairly shaky ground.Then Bruce gets a shot at anchorman, only to have it underhandedly stolen by Evan Baxter. Obviously not please, Bruce shares his thoughts with the world through the television in a way which is comical and definitely worthy of getting him fired.Much complaining and griping about God later, Bruce gets a page. After a while he gets tired of it calling, so he responds and goes to the Omni Presents building (heh). There he meets God (Freeman), who is the Boss, Electrician, and Janitor of the building. I found this highly amusing. God is the Boss, the Holy Spirit is the Electrician, and Jesus Christ is the Janitor. Think about it. Boss, obvious. Electrician, the guy who keeps everything running. Janitor, the guy who cleans up the mess that the world has left. BRILLIANT.Anyway, Bruce is a little skeptical about having actually met God, but when God gives Bruce his powers and gives him a shot at playing God, he starts to believe a bit. Wonder why. Enter the flagrant abuse of powers for personal gain and to abuse the enemies.Since this is Hollywood, Bruce obviously eventually smartens up, learns his lesson, and starts using his powers for the good of the world. In the end he cries out for God to take it away and prays that His will be done, not Bruce's.Since it is Jim Carrey, the movie is quite amusing, and there are definitely some highly entertaining moments in it. The movie is not perfect theology, but for Hollywood, it is definitely a good attempt. Many statements in the film can be quite thought provoking and even challenging, and I applaud Tom Shadyac for his effort in this movie.So, while far from perfect, definitely an amusing popcorn movie with a little bit of thought behind it.Bottom Line: 3.5 out of 4 (worth a view or two)",positive,en,2
"I have tried a lot of different boutique hotels in New York, usually downtown, and have never been disappointed... until now. The East Houston hotel already looks dated, very loud (both from the traffic outside and the out-of-control ventilation system in the hotel which makes it feel like you're sleeping in a construction site). The ""complimentary breakfast"" is a joke, served in a soul-less basement with paper plates and cutlery, stale bagels and teacher's lounge coffee canisters.

"I stayed at the cosmopolitan for our 5 year anniversary.

There was no bath scrub, etc. which most hotels in this price range offer. \n- gym access was 20 bucks per day - I actually had made sure that the hotel had gym, I guess they forget to mention that you have to pay to use it\n- renting a chair at the pool was a few hundred bucks\n- chocolate cake took 1 hour to arrive and wasn't that good\n- we ate at the Chinese+mexican restaurant which was basically overpriced and lousy food.\n- the bathroom light wasn't working, so i called the concierge. nothing happened for 2 hours, and I had to call again. they said the previous person didn't put the request in.\n\nI have stayed in a lot of vegas hotels, both for work and pleasure from 60 per night to the mgm sky lofts - but this hotel has underwhelmed me the most.

The Barrie has peanut butter, bacon and cheese. I bit into it and immediately put it down and opened it to make sure it actually had peanut butter in it. Yup. It did. Weird. Nothing really stood out in terms of flavors. Pretty much tasted like a cheeseburger. The Mad Sconie burger which comes with fried pickles, bacon, better beef burger and spicy cheese bun was also tasteless and \""uninspired\"". This is the award winning burger, so either this was an off night or someone hasn't tasted Old Fashioned Burgers.\n\nFinally our waitress was not very friendly.

"This place can be a headache. It's really nice and decorated well from the entrance and the waiting area/line, but it can get way too crowded for no reason. For the females, that one hour from 11 pm to 12 pm is PRECIOUS. If you are there with male friends, you'll constantly be hugging the bar and trying to give out your drinks to your male friends and also downing some for yourself. Once 12 pm hits, the club is packed in both dance rooms and the space is LIMITED. The whole point of loosening up and having fun cannot be spent well at TAO if that's the kind of night you're going for. Upstairs at the outdoor area is still pretty crowded too, so there's not much you can run away for open air and space. \n\nHowever, the magical bathrooms upstairs are a definite plus.

"We stayed at the Waldorf on our first trip to New York. Despite reviews I had seen here that were negative, we found our visit very pleasant and the concierge was amazing! The rooms were very clean and exhibited a lovely old-world charm. True, ammenities like in-room coffee makers were not included, but I believe that the presence of some of the more modern ammenities would have detracted from the charm. When I needed to find a dentist after 7PM on a Sunday night for an emergency root canal, the lady at concierge took incredible care of me. Within 45 minutes I was at the dentist, having the dental work completed. As a result of this excellent customer service, from both the concierge at the Waldorf and dentist Dr. Chan, I was able to continue enjoying my visit to New York the very next day.

"I have to say that I must agree with the terrible reviews of this place. It has got to be one of THE worst ""hotels"" I have ever had the displeasure of staying. Out of no choice of my own, our school district booked it for a conference that I was attending in July. (The conference hall, which is part of the Town and Country, is a step up from the rest of the hotel).
I'll begin with the total disorganization in the lobby during check-in... Granted, there were a zillion teachers and other guests swarmed in the lobby, but one would think that by now management would have implemented some sort of organized procedure for handling guests at such high volumes. No one seemed to know what was going on and the times we were told our rooms would be ready varied from one staff person to another.
As we trekked through the overgrown jungle-like walkways to get to a restaurant for breakfast, we landed upon a low-class version of a cafe. It looked like some sort of side of the highway Jerry's Restaurant from the 1960s. After standing in a line that went out the door, we were seated at separate tables (not a big deal, since there were 9 of us). However, after waiting forever I was hoping for a meal that was at least somewhat palatable. I'm not sure how you go wrong with a cheese omlet and potatoes, but they managed to. The potatoes were charred and the omlet was grey - everything tasted like a piece of charcoal! Yuck!! After two bites, I paid my twelve dollars and easily convinced the rest of our group never to dine here again. I've never paid so much for such a disgusting meal.
Several hours later we had a room. With all of the money that they get from ripping people off, I don't see how they can't afford to update the place. The rooms were dark, dirty, old, and just plain old creepy. They have this bizarre old Victorian thing going on as their decor. The bathrooms have peeling wall paper and the shower doesn't seem to have been scrubbed since they built the hotel. There were special hairs in my bed and on a few ""clean"" towels. Yes, the special kind that you keep down under. The toilet backed up even after having someone come in and ""fix"" it. The walls are paper thin. We could hear our neighbors brushing their teeth and unfortunately for us, we got to smell their cigarette smoke all night and morning while in the room. Haven't they heard of separating smoking floors from non-smoking floors??? I've read several reviews about the beautiful grounds and pools. Not true... Unless you consider gardens littered in trash and worn down pools littered with seedy characters everywhere beautiful.
This ""hotel"" couldn't have gotten things more wrong. They need to shut down and renovate every inch of this property. Perhaps back in the 1950s or 60s this place was of resort quality, but it has since been flushed to sewer quality. I would NEVER recommend this place to anyone. There are by far nicer hotels to enjoy while staying in San Diego. The only plus to this experience was that I didn't have to pay for my stay.",negative,en,0

I know it is fashionable now to hate this movie. I have seen hundreds of spook films including he original 1963 Haunting as well as most of the Hammer films. This film is not restrained and does not hold back at all which is probably why so many modern viewers seemed not to like it. Yet many viewers can accept out of control films like Scream because knife killers are more easy to believe for most people than demons or ghosts. Actually this film had many great scenes and the acting and special effects were great. I have seen it 15 times now and it gets better every time. The director of this film has made a number of interesting and stylish films and was not trying for the type of realism of the 6th sense. The Haunting lets go and is certainly not boring. Perhaps this film might appeal more to John Carpenter fans but more of an traditional plot structure. The old Haunting was also a fine film from 1963. It was even more scary. See both and also The Innocents and The Legend of Hell House with Pamela Franklin.,positive,en,2

"Fellow Meatyelpers,\n\nI cannot emphasize this 5 star rating enough. I would deduct one star for the lack of actual Brazilian personnel working at this location, but the food was just so good that I forgot about that mundane detail. \n\nI had seen this restaurant before a couple of years ago and since the opportunity arose once again to try it out, I completely grabbed onto it and went for the meat ride (no homo).\n\nThe location is marvelous, situated in the middle of Tryon's main drag in uptown Charlotte. When compared to the other Brazilian Rodizio style steakhouses which I have eaten at, this one outshines both in its location (see my reviews for the other two in Orlando, FL). It is tucked into the lobby of one of the many beautifully designed highrises in Charlotte. I presume rent must cost an arm and a leg, luckily they use cows for that at Chima.\n\nUpon entering I was immediately taken back by the superb decor of the place. A large waiting area that is very modern with some light fixtures akin to a 1970s attempt at a futuristic home. The lobby is slightly elevated which gives you, the guest, a grandiose view of all the meat comas going on in that very special ward known as the dining area. Smack dab in the middle of the dining area is a very respectable salad bar that in my opinion fell a tad short of expectations. The upstairs area provides space for a private dining rom and a very nicely set up lounge complete with an awesome bar. All this can be reached via a mansion style round stairwell or by using the elevator located at the lobby. This is good for those who cannot walk once done with their meals (refer to my photos for the aforementioned description).\n\nExpect to be treated extra special like a baby in an incubator. These meat surgeons will take care of all your needs until you are ready to go home to mom. The servers are extremely courteous and attentive. You can request any specialty meats that you may have missed out on during your meal and it will be promptly brought to your table.\n\nYou will receive many sides to accompany your meal as well as the salad bar option. However, you can opt out of the meats and go for a cheaper all you can eat swordfish/salmon and salad bar dinner which will you run you about half of the meat dinner price. \n\nThe sides consist of Mashed Potatoes, Fried Bananas, Parmesan Cheese Bread, Polenta, Beef Croquettes and a nice spread to put on your bread (see my photos). Please do not focus on these as you want to have as much room as possible to enjoy the overwhelming amount of meats being served by your friendly neighborhood gaucho.\n\nThe salad bar has plenty of items to choose from along with some brazilian staples such as the Feijoada. I won't focus on this since it's a salad bar in a STEAKHOUSE. Vegetarians, hit your browser's back button now.\n\nThe meats that stood out for me were as follows: The Picanha, Leg of Lamb, Lamb Chops, Bacon Wrapped Chicken and Parmesan Pork, Filet Mignon and Ribs. Although, all were delicious including the Picanha which is Brazil's prime cut, I have yet to taste better Lamb in my life. The seasoning on both the Leg of Lamb and Lamb Chops was out of this world delicious (see my photos). I highly recommend it. It's so magical, I can't even put it into words. Think of the best tasting cut of meat you have ever had and multiply that by the highest scientific notation ever and that won't equal the amount of excitement my taste buds had when this work of culinary art touched them. Pure meat bliss.\n\nI think I have said enough to convince you to at least try their Lamb! Go here because this place is fantastic. If you don't have a good dining experience e-mail me personally and I'll paypal you the amount of your dinner in full. This is my personal guarantee of how much you'll like it. By the way, if you don't enjoy your dinner, my paypal account is run out of Nigeria, tread lightly when giving me your information. I'm kidding of course, just disregard the whole refund offer and enjoy your dinner here!\n\nAbracos!",positive,en,2

"My father drags me everywhere--from Fry's Electronics to Popeye Chicken (UGH). Native Grill & Wings is actually one of the few places in which I do not dislike anything. I decided to write a simple easy review on this particular location, so why not? Let's cut to the chase.\n\nPros:\nI'm not exactly a sports fan, but this is DEFINITELY a place for one. There are TVs everywhere, throughout the patios, the indoor areas, and at the bar. They are all constantly switched on to ESPN, FOX Sports, and on rare occasions, ESPN2. From the looks of it, it seemed impossible to not have a clear view of the TV screen without having someone's head, arm, etc. block your way. We came on Sunday, and the wings are crazy cheap. The fish and chips had a pretty decent taste, as we split them all up between the three of us. The service was not particularly the nicest, nor the meanest, but was speedy when talking to us. They had great placing of all the heat lamps and chairs outside in the patio, so it is great to come during the winter. The location is fairly large, so you can almost always find a table to sit at.\n\nCons:\nThe patio had not many places to put your used cigarettes. I am not a smoker, nor do I give any offense to smokers, but the patio REEKS of smoke. The service here is fast-speaking, but not exactly fast-moving. We waited for several minutes between when we asked for the check and the delivery of the check itself. The fish and chips had decent taste, but not decent size. They were tiny compared to the fish and chips in the OTHER location for the same price and meal. I was really disappointed when I saw this. We did not get enough wings. There were only 4 wings for the 3 of us for EACH dish. \n\nOverall, this is simply not the greatest restaurant I've experienced. Its other competitors were able to show a performance at least twenty times better than this one. Thanks, but I'd rather visit the Ahwatukee location from this time on.",negative,en,0

"Hummus chicken plate and a honeymooner! After a funfilled Gluttonous, and overindulging weekend of Nachos, Mac n' Cheese, Martinis and hot dogs I needed a break! \n\nThe best thing about Aladdin's is that it's not like I have to compromise on taste and turn into a cow chewing some cud. This place has delicious AND healthy selections! When HB asked me to dine I said \""Only if we can eat at Aladdin's my gut needs a hiatus from the unhealthy choices I made all weekend.\"" \n\nI have been doing the awesome onesome for quick lunches here for Years!\nThese are my favorites!\n\nThe fresh squeezed natural Juices! You can do fruit smoothies or Raw juice combos! I don't drink coffee I opt for Raw Juices, some people get their caffeine fix to give them a boost. I'm already way too hyper so I get my energy kick from the Honeymooner! Carrot, Grape, and Cucumber Juices. I ask for it light on Carrot with an overdose of Cucumber.\n\nFor a soupy choice try the Len-Chili, half veggie chili and lentil soup. If you are partial to paring add the Almond salad. Fresh mixed greens, mushrooms, cucumbers, sprouts, roasted almonds! The dressing is also AMAZING, light and yogurty. It has a fantastic flavor.\n\nIf in the mood for something a little heavier try the Jaffar's Pitza. It's really good. Veggie chili topped with cheddar cheese and tahini yogurt dressing.\n\nFor an Entree hummus is plentiful in the hummus chicken plate, Chicken Mishwi, diced tomato, and parsley. Pita on the side. The chicken is always moist, slighty charred, and smokey but with the bean spread and fresh tomato mix on a pita I feel good about what I am consuming. Everything is always verdant! \n\nWatch Out for the desserts. On my way out I always cover my eyes because the gourmet cakes start pounding on the display case doors asking for a ride to my fridge.",neutral,en,1

"This series is one of the worst shows I have ever seen. Terrible acting, terrible effects, terrible writing, you get my drift. The stories are so far from the legend of Robin Hood it's amazing. Looks like they just wanted to use the name Robin Hood to attract an audience. It might as well have been called New Adventures of Mr. Bland Acting.Someone commented before me that if you had imagination, you'd love this show. That is a horrible approach to a TV-series. A visual media like this should spark your imagination, you shouldn't have to force your imagination into something to make it good. That would be like the Simpsons episode where they try to brainwash Homer with a religious propaganda movie, and he starts talking about who killed who or whatever. ""If a movie is boring, I just make up my own story.""In conclusion: Absolute human waste.",negative,en,0
"I was so happy to hear that a close friend was in town. I asked him to join me for lunch one and his response was that he was in the mood for Thai food. I knew there was only one place we could go that was close to both of us and offered a really great menu. Yes, Pin Kaow!!\n\nThis place is located in a HUGE strip mall along with other great places like BJs. The restaurant is dark with lots of wood: blinds, walls, counter space, you name it. The smell of incense fills the air and the bar is a dramatic focal point with a mock roof top. The place is filled with wooden sculptures of koi fish, lots of Thai tribal designs on the wall and between the booths, all of it is super cool. Servers are dressed in authentic Thai outfits with lots of light orange and green colors. I thought they were super nice and always checked on our table frequently. I also liked how everyone pitched in. Our drink order was taken by one server. Our food order was taken by another. Other servers would come by the check on us and I thought that was cool. \n\nOn this visit, although it was during my lunch break, I got a glass of the Altanuta Pinot Grigio for $8.95. I thought it was light and crisp, the way Grigio should taste like. For my lunch, I got the lunch special chicken Pad Thai with a Thai salad for $8.95. The Pad Thai was awesome. I got a number 4 in the spicy range. The rice noodles were accompanied with fresh bean sprouts and crushed peanut in Thai special recipe sauce. The salad components were romaine and shredded carrots, super typical. What I really liked was the Thai vinaigrette dressing. I made the salad refreshing and flavorful. \n\nSuch great company and great food. Definitely want to check out Pin Kaow if you ever have a Thai craving. There's three locations around the valley. This location is the only location I've been too, but I love it! Super convenient, great staff and food that's YUM-O!",neutral,en,1

"Judging from this film and THE STRONG MAN, made the same year, I would not place Harry Langdon at the top of the list of great silent screen comedians. There simply is not enough there. Perhaps he was on his way to developing his style but sabotaged himself by taking his first big successes too seriously. In any event, all of his tricks are reminiscent of the greater funny men, but he lacks the acrobatic skills of Keaton and the prodigious ingenuity of Lloyd. He also undermines his own persona by dressing and walking like Chaplin's tramp character. His trademarks are childlike innocence, timidity of approach and a tendency to under-react to calamity by looking perplexed, batting his eyes or touching his pursed lips with the tip of his forefinger. The comedy in Langdon's films results from fate throwing various obstacles in his path which he tries to overcome in wimpy or naïve ways or with a minimum of physicality, such as throwing rocks at an approaching tornado to drive it away, propping up a collapsing building with a two-by-four or dodging boulders by lifting a leg so that they roll under him.

Parking here used to be free. It is now $14 per day. There is not a good system for collecting parking funds, so if you leave at a popular time (like dinner) expect to wait in a traffic line for 5-10 minutes.
Don't believe the pictures the resort has posted on TripAdvisor.
The pool has been patched multiple times leaving a rough and uneven surface. The rest of the grounds need help too.
The main restaurant was very good, some of the best food I've eaten at a hotel. But, I don't stay at the hotel for the food.

"This wonderful 1983 BBC television production (not a movie, as others have written here) of the classic love story ""Jane Eyre"", starring Timothy Dalton as Rochester, and Zelah Clarke as Jane, is the finest version that has been made to date, since it is the most faithful to the novel by Charlotte Bronte in both concept and dialogue. A classic becomes a classic for very specific reasons; when film producers start to meddle with a classic's very lifeblood then that classic is destroyed. Thankfully the producers of THIS ""Jane Eyre"" approached the story with respect and faithfulness towards the original, which results in a spectacularly addictive concoction that is worth viewing multiple times, to enjoy its multi-layers of sweetness and delight and suspense. The performances are delightful, the music is just right, even the Gothic design of the house and outdoor shots are beautiful, and set the right tone for the production. My only criticism, though slight, is that this version, like every other version ever made of Jane Eyre, ignores the Christian influences that built Jane's character and influenced her moral choices. In today's modern world a woman in Jane's situation wouldn't think twice but to stay with Rochester after finding out he had an insane wife and was still married to her. ""Oh, just get a divorce"", she would say to her man, or she would live in sin with him. But Jane Eyre knew she couldn't settle for this course in life and respect herself. Why? This decision was based on the foundations of the Christian faith she had been taught since childhood, not from the brutal Calvinist Lowood Institution, but from the Christian example of a true friend, Helen Burns, who was martyred rather than not turn the other cheek. Someday I would like to see some version depict these influences a little more fully in an adaptation. A classic novel that ends with the heroine writing ""Even so, come Lord Jesus!"" should not have the foundations of that faith stripped out of it.",positive,en,2

I was uber excited to have a \""true pizza\"" place in the NW part of Vegas.

It was topped with a hearty couple strips of applewood smoked bacon with japanese BBQ sauce/wasabi mayo and the odd ingredient that packed a punch: red ginger (yes, fact). They do prepare the burger medium rare unless requested otherwise which causes the beef to be so tender and flavorful. It does get a bit messy, but once your knee deep in beef that's an apple/orange situation trust me!\n\nAlso with honorable mention was the fuku fries seasoned with garlic salt and something else which I didn't catch, but I believe something of the japanese spice decent which did seem to tease my taste buds with a good time quite well and those are highly recommended to accompany the cow platter!\n\nThe price runs about $27 for 2 burgers, fries, and drinks which certainly leaves your wallet feeling like a \""grand champion\"" and the staff was top notch..They were patient as we took our time with the menu and went well beyond their capacity to leave us feeling welcome then and certainly in the future!\n\nThey are certainly something new and a stray from the norm of a normal burger for sure, but it is \""Fuk\""in good so be there and don't grow square!",positive,en,2

"Here's an update to my earlier review. \n\nAs stated before, I really WANT to like this place. However, I lunched there the other day and, sadly, have decided I'm done. \n\nThe chips and salsa are awesome and my toddler daughter was pleased with her chicken fingers. But my wife and I split the lunch chicken fajitas and they were, to say the least, the weirdest fajitas we've ever had. \n\nI'm no Tex-Mex expert, but my experience with fajitas is that they're strips of chicken, onions, and peppers served sizzling on a cast-iron platter. The vegetables are typically cooked just past the point of tenderness.\n\nThe fajitas brought to our table consisted of chunks of what appeared to be a small baked breast atop a pile of what appeared to be an overdone pepper/onion mash which was bitter to the taste. The sides (guac, pico, cheese, lettuce) were excellent though.\n\nI'm still a big fan of Frank's Cantina 1511 and Mama Ricotta's but not crazy about Big (Bad) Daddy's though or now, Paco's.",negative,en,0

"This review is overdue as the stay was made in Dec 2011. Anyway, the hotel is luxurious and well kept like what many others have describe. So I'll just mention some of the things that I value.
As I'm a rather light sleeper, sound insulation is important. The room we were given was good enough for me.
Location wise, it's not the best for us as tourists. The hotel is kinda sandwiched between the central business district and the tourist areas. So if I had been on business and then decided to take some time off after the business trip then this would have been perfect.
Their complimentary morning coffee was always very popular, there were times when we went down at around 9:30am and it was almost all gone (or out of cream etc). Perhaps they should replenish it more regularly (or somehow make people sleep later, ha !)",positive,en,2
"This is the number one place to have a drink for a spectacular view of Vegas. We have even gone to Mix with residents of Vegas and they were shocked at the magnificent night time views. Service is good and the drinks are fun. It's not cheap but it shouldn't be with that view. Also-check out the bathrooms, they are a trip ( I have only heard about the ladies room). You HAVE to go for the evening view at least once.\n\nThe only reason I did not assign 5 stars is the following: It was a chilly night and Mix does have kerosene heaters near the tables. When we asked the manager to light ours up, he said he could not because there was not enough fuel to keep it lit though the entire night and he needed it later for the \""club crowd.\"" That is a bad answer-At $16-$20 a drink you can buy more fuel. He did come through with some blankets for the women in our group though.",neutral,en,1
"Had Monday morning breakfast here and there was no wait at 8am. Typical American style breakfast, no frills, no specialty items.\n\nI agree with others in that service here is excellent. Servers are nice, prompt and attentive. Coffee was decent and servers make sure your cup is always full. Portions are generous.\n\nVeggie omelet: ordered only egg whites with very little oil, and they did a good job with it. Came with cottage cheese, which I like, and toast.\n\nSteak and eggs: smallish piece of steak but not sure we really should be eating more than that. Hash browns were crisp but tasted greasy.\n\nThey gave us a fresh cup of coffee to go when we asked for a cup for our current coffee -- that was nice of them!",negative,en,0

"My husband and I had an absolutely fabulous anniversary meal at the Sofitel in Chicago thanks to Lonnie and Mike, Managers of Banquets and the Restaurant. We were greeted by charming wait staff and Maitre 'D. The Chef came out to ask what we wanted for our meal as he was going to prepare something special. We started with Champagne and had a fabulous six course meal of caprese, sweet breads, octopus and snapper, fois gras, rabbit, halibut and then two fabulous desserts. What an absolutely fantastic culinary experience. The combinations of tastes were incredible! The Chef and staff did an excellent job and we truly enjoyed our evening. Thank you so much for arranging such a special meal. You are terrific and we love the hotel. Exceptional meal and service. We would definitelyclass that as a five star meal you could have had at any of the finest french restaurants in the country. Magnifique! Thanks, Angela and Tom Donohue, Dallas, Tx",positive,en,2

"The service is ok at best. Given it's usually a handful of high school kids who work there I tend to be a little more forgiving, but clearly whoever is managing this location and training these kids doesn't have a clue. In fact I've seen the who appears to be the manager be part of the problem... On at least 5 occasions in the last 2 months I've been at the drive thru waiting for my coffee while it appears to be social hour inside... including the women who seems to be in charge.\n\nLast night I ordered 2 sundaes. They were made and sat at the window for at least 5 minutes while they prepared something for the car in front of me. When I got to the window I asked why they wouldn't have had the car pull around so my ice cream didn't melt.. that was met with \""oh, ya we should have done that.\"" No offer to remake my sundaes.\n\nThe original owner/manager had this place running like a top!

"I encourage everyone to stay away from this hotel. The service is terrible. One of their valet parking workers gave me my car back with 2 feet long scraping on the rear door along with a big dent. When I reported the damage to them the administration resorted to procrastination tactics and after two weeks of waiting they informed me that their insurance company would not cover the damage. I am still fighting it, and will do my best to get them to pay for what they have done to my car. What upsets me the most is that the valet driver did not acknowledge the accident and deliberately attempted to conceal it from me. Moreover, the hotel administration added more insults to the injury by evading being held accountable. So, my advice to all of you to is to find a different hotel that really value their guests and take care of their properties. This one has failed miserably in all these basic services.",negative,en,0

SHOCKING EXPERIENCE for a first time customer!!! I preordered the iPhone 14 Pro Max 128GB in space black. Two areas on the web page both confirming if I ordered now delivery would be on the 16th of September. The night before I’m informed that in fact I won’t be getting it until the 30th of September. I spoke to customer services who firstly denied any mention that delivery was meant for the 16th and told me that there’s a chance I could be waiting past their next delivery date of the 30th. Shocking and unprofessional. No choice to wait and see what happens as it’s impossible to get hold of the phone from any other retailer.

Not to mention the ""hotel"" itself is hedious, old, dirty, with a disgusting filthy bath; dust all over the room. I couldn't barely sleep, because the matress was probably at least 40 years old. Do I need to add it was dirty and smelly as well?

"I stayed at this hotel for 3 days. I didn't have any major issues with my stay just a lot of small issues that would probably prevent me from staying at this hotel again.
Pros: Price compared to other NYC hotels, staff was very helpful and friendly. Charming neighborhood with lots of exotic things to see.
Cons: Location - right in Chinatown where the fragrance of the many outdoor seafood markets is quite prominent and sometimes very overwhelming; Room amenities/appointments - if you're accustomed to staying at hotels where certain amenities are standard, this hotel will disappoint you. There is no wifi (in this day and age - that is a really a standard), instant coffee (need I say more), poor lighting in the room (single lamp in the entire room), single mirror (only in the bathroom - for ladies who like to do their makeup while someone else is in the bathroom - no such luck with one mirror); Convenience and safety: getting around during the day is fine. Seward Park is a just a block or two away where there is a subway line and lots of waiting cabs. Coming back to the hotel late at night (which is what you do when staying in NYC), you might not feel entirely comfortable navigating back to the hotel - one wrong turn and you might be in a less than desirable area. Take a cab at for late night returns to the hotel.
Overall: I think the hotel is fine for young people and those who have an adventurous side. However, after visiting other downtown areas, I think I would have preferred something in Soho (if staying downtown is what you want to do).",negative,en,0

"A colleague and I checked out of the Westin Galleria Dallas today after a 2-day work conference held at the hotel. For 2 nights, our room was priced at well over $500. When that kind of money is involved, there are certain expectations that naturally occur, the most important being cleanliness. As hotels are a public place, there are certain cautions that one might expect to take in general - like using a Clorox wipe on the remote control or not walking around in the bathroom with bare feet, for instance. What is NOT expected, is to find semen stains dotting and dripping down the headboard, which was the case in our room. Of course, this left me feeling quite uneasy and not really able to relax and ""enjoy"" my stay. A little more attention by the housekeeping staff would be appreciated, as these stains weren't exactly invisible. Anybody paying any attention at all would have noticed, and thus should have been cleaned accordingly. While I am aware that my room has been occupied many times prior to my arrival, I do not expect to deal with the things previous guests leave behind. Uncool, Westin. (While I do have a picture of the stains, I will refrain from posting them on this public site.)",negative,en,0

"My fiancee and I stayed at HRH last May. We were pretty stoked since we were coming from a fresh, long winter in Montana and were looking forward to some R&R. However, customer service here does not allow for R&R. For some reason the phone became this insane issue on their part, the pools were randomly closed at the discretion of whomever. The people working in HRH are clearly annoyed by the people who frequent the resort because getting help was an issue. Overall, we will give it a 2 star because we liked the rooms and the pools (that were open). However at this point in our life, saving a few bucks is not worth the commute back and forth to the Strip, customer service was hardly good, plus the crowd is much better at several spots we found during our trip - clearly, our next time will be best spent elsewhere and this June we are headed to the Cosmopolitan.

"I was kind of dubious about this place, being a \""-berto's\"" joint and all, but it's pretty terrific grub. The service is great and they keep the dining area squeaky clean with a widescreen TV tuned into a Mexican news station. They also have free wi-fi, which I haven't yet tried. I swung by there today and had the carne asada torte. This is a huge sandwich (about 9\""x6\"") with a swatch of thinly sliced beef, lettuce, tomato and guacamole, served on a yummy homemade roll. It's served with french fries, a heckuva deal for $3.99. I've also had their burrito plate, easily big enough for two meals. Delicious, affordable, filling, what more can one ask for. At the very least, you can sit in this repurposed Burger King and dig the circa 1991 decor.",neutral,en,1

"I used to be in love! I can't knock the quality of the actual hair service I receive here it is great. I love the haircuts and blow outs even with them being far more expensive than a hair cut should be. However I am so upset and disappointed with my personal experience. I have been turned away from this salon 3 times. seriously. They say they accept walkin's but that is not really true. Due to my job and work schedule it's so hard to make appointments in advance so I loved them for taking me as a walking. My First experience -I called, they said no available appointments and I happened to be in the parking lot so I walked in anyway and said I would wait but the salon was empty and Heather was able to take me right away. That was a fluke I thought. My next attempt was last weekend on a Sunday morning walked in and was told we can't accept any other appointments because of the Country Music Awards. I begged but I kind of understood. However I wish I would have reminded them I am a local customer that will be here AFTER the awards are over. MY FINAL attempt was the Tuesday afternoon following this - I had more time than usual as I was traveling out of town hence my need for pretty hair! I walked in-they said they are not available I told them my story of being turned away multiple times and the Manager walked to the back came back and said sorry nothing he can do. Really! They were stylists available I don't care they may have an appointment in a few minutes there was time. I do not buy it. NOTHING was done and it was as if they didn't care. I guess they don't need just local business or my little bit of business.",negative,en,0

"Unpretentious hotel in an ideal location for those new to Boston. Right outside the T station so really easy to get to from the airport - for $5. The room was average in every respect and we had no problem with housekeeping. The hotel renovations are confined to the lobby at present so no noise in rooms at all. However, street located rooms will have street noise and the US does start working earlier in the morning than the UK so be prepared for that. Once renovations are complete, not sure what the hotel will be like as there a bar and restaurant are planned but meantime, if you want an affordable, centrally located hotel in Boston that's not fancy shmancy - you can't really beat this.",positive,en,2

"The units in this place is worthy of 5 stars - the rest of the experience is what makes this place 1 star but by law of averages I gave them an extra star.\n\nWe stayed in a one bedroom unit. It was pretty much a one bedroom condo/apartment. Full amenities, washer and dryer as well. Fireplace, full kitchen, full bath with a huge bath tub that probably would have fit 4 adults easily. Comfortable room, tons of parking and easy access (a block away) to the main strip made this place great.\n\nWhat wasn't great the experience. We stayed here as a time share option. We went through the seminar - we even purchased a time share. The night before having to check out we request a late check out - front desk told us they can move it from 9am to 11am. At 9:30 we had a knock on the door asking when were leaving. We told them we had until 11am approved by front desk. Housekeeping left. Another knock at 10:15 asking when we are leaving. Then a phone call at 10:30, another knock at 10:45, 10:55, and 11am. We didn't feel the least bit valued as guests. We felt overly harassed as new time share owners.\n\nWe ended up cancelling our time share ownership because of this experience and even THEN no one would return our calls or emails for 5 days (which the 5th day was the last day we could have rescind the ownership).

"this is awesome!!! there is no partnership quite like Errol, and Olivia. there love is genuine! I'm 24, yet this flick is as captivating now as I'm sure it was 60 years ago. Raoul Walsh is an under-rated genius, his direction is so sweeping, so broad, yet so intimate. the last scene between colonel custer (Flynn), and his wife (de havilland), almost brought me to tears (Not easy for a 24yr old guy!!), its so heart-wrenching. there is also a deep Christian message implicit here, the faith Custer has in taking your glory with you, and the trust, and fidelity of his wife to the extent of letting him go, in order that he fulfils his moral duty to protect the innocent civilians from certain massacre. there is no movie that deals with these issues quite like this. a must-see for anyone who wants to look at this defining moment in American, and military history, from the inside. patriotic, for all the right reasons. i knew Errol Flynn was a star, and De havilland was a screen legend-this only confirms my suspicions that they are among the very greatest!",positive,en,2

"Total Wine is a wine lover's heaven!! Since it was the Grand Opening, they had a few stations of wine tastings! At the door, a worker was checking ID's and handing out glasses for those who wanted to wine taste. It was quite busy the afternoon we went. \n\nThey had a few stations that had wine tastings of different types. White, Red, French, Napa wines. They also had smirnoff malt drinks, tanqueray, and MGD samples as well. They were giving away some freebies like drink shakers, mints, and a lime squeezer.\n\nMost of the workers who were giving out the wine were very informative and helpful. They'd explain the different wines, their age, description, etc.\n\nI love how organized and easy to find things are at Total Wine. They are organized by types of wine. Not like Lee's where you could be going up and down every aisle not really able to find what you are looking for because they are organized by location the wine is from.\n\nThere were complimentary magazines on wines. I took one and it is a pretty fat magazine all about wines. \n\nThey also have hard liquor, all types of beers, sake, etc etc. They sell beer by the bottle as well and you are able to make your own 6-pack. Pretty cool since you could get six different types that your heart desires. They even sell chips, olives, caviar, nuts, etc. Things you can find as a grocery store for a little cheaper but cool that they have it. \n\nI love Total Wine and glad they opened one in Henderson.

"The Finnish version of Robert Altman's ""Short Cuts"", set in the small rural town of Äänekoski. The episodes present a kaleidoscope of the eternal events, problems and emotions of human life: joy and love, deception and disillusionment, hopelessness and death. I was particularly impressed by two episodes. The first is the story of the young waitress, who tries to stir up a romance for his co-workers: she radiates an overwhelming joy of love and life. The other episode presents and old man dying in a hospital and his wife trying to help him die with dignity. Particularly striking is the way the old couple have to fight their way against the humiliating practices of the hospital and their loneliness contrasted with the ""routines"" of the hospital crew (despite the signs of occasional empathy). Compared with Altman's classic, this movie is perhaps less professional, but it is definitely a great piece of art.",positive,en,2

"My wife and I booked a Towers Level Queen for two nights over the Easter Weekend; at just over $300 a night, and the assurance that this was a four star establishment, I expected a fairly luxurious stay.
Instead, I'll categorize my disappointment, in the hopes that making a list will make the whole review more palatable.
1) Towers Level Lounge: is closed on the weekend! You can however, help yourself to a cold continental breakfast in the crowded lobby restaurant
2) Private Express Elevator: Neither private, or express
3) Private Workstation: Is a desk, with an old office phone. Be prepared to pay an extra $13 a night for internet access, per device! Who charges for wifi anymore? There's also a coffee maker, but without a fridge (which means there's no milk or cream) and no sugar.
4) Cotton robes and slippers: One old ratty cotton robe about as soft as a horseblanket (no slippers to be found).
5) Individual Climate Control: They must mean 'the window', because our thermostat did nothing to help with the cold
6) The Gym: Just a line of treadmills and a selection of dumbbells, in a low ceiling non-nondescript room I assume was once a storage basement - no barbells, no racks, no sauna or steam room and certainly no pool
To top it off, the fire alarm went off in the middle of the night for over an hour, and there was a constant thrumming noise in the room, like a small engine or an industrial air conditioner
For less than half the price you could stay at a cheap chain hotel, and you'd receive twice as many amenities

During my two nights staying at this hotel, i feel it's great to stay with HI express.
They have fitness room, indoor pool, and **Above Ave. Contine. BK**
The location is awsome as you walk to Space needle within 10 plus mins or 20 mins to Nordstrom.
Internet access is a plus <But> bring your enternet cable! or simply use the one computer at lobby.
The 24 hrs gas station across the street can pretty much fill the need for anything you probably would be looking for. e.g. Water/ Drinks....etc
However, there are also a few things i dont think about this hotel:
We wanted two rooms with interconnected door so that we can chat easily with each other during our stay, and they forgot about it by giving the room next door to another guest to check in. <But> They did manage and luckily finding another pair of room with
interconnected door for my group of people.
Crowded BK lounge room (less people around 910-10am if you plan to have their BK)

I changed to another interior room that had a queen-sized bed but the room's condition was the same as the first one: scratched, old furniture, out-dated carpet, and furniture that had seen far better days. The HVAC wasn't working well and we spent a stuffy night - fresh air was out since the one window overlooked the interior light well. The bathroom was clean and well outfitted, in stark contrast to the rest of the room. What was perhaps the most ironic part of the whole experience was that there was a flat screen HDTV in a room full of furniture and decor that was desperate to be updated. It was the first time I ever equated the terms ""dump"" and ""Westin.""

"I stayed at the hotel April 21-23 and was pleasantly surprised. From some other reviews, i was convinced it was going to be bad. Hotel is in a good neighborhod. As a single, the rooms are small but hey, it is New York City, what are you doing in the room anyway? The room I had was redone and was located on the 8th floor. It was consistently clean as was the bathroom down the hall. Maybe something like 10 rooms total on a floor (some with their own bathrooms) to the 2 common bathroom/shower areas.

"""Cut"" is a film about some film students making a film. It's very much in the ""Scream"" mold, an ironic, self-referential horror flick which, for me at least, falls down because for all its irony, it's still just a bad horror film, same as the films its referring to.But it was not without its charms. Well, one charm anyway. Molly Ringwald was fantastic as the spoilt, bitchy American actress hating every minute of working with the amateur Australian film crew. She was so convincing that its tempting to believe it wasn't an act, although everyone involved with ""Cut"" says she was lovely to work with. :-)Seriously, every scene of her pouting, sulking or snapping was great. Everyone else, however, wavered between being OK and being terribly wooden.Anyway, ""Cut"" has some laughs, a few buckets of gore (some of it surprisingly gruesome), and ultimately is.. just another bad horror film.",negative,en,0

"*** out of ****Yep! Dressed To Kill is that kind of a movie. It's like Kalifornia, but it's different. Remember? That movie from 1993 which stars Brad Pitt as a serial killer who is ""welcomed"" by a couple of travelers in a trip to California as a buddy who might be a good company along the way. When I watch a movie, I always like not to know anything at all about the plot, before watching it, because the surprises may get even cooler. That's how it was with Kalifornia. When I watched it last year for the first time, I never realized it was a suspense movie, so when I found out, I was shocked, and when the movie went on and on, it got even better and I was at the edge of my seat, almost kissing my monitor, so close I was to it! So, we're discussing about Dressed To Kill, right? Before I watched this movie (today!), I've only watched 2 others movies from Brian De Palma, so I can say I don't really know that well his works, but can tell from afar that these 2 movies for me were as great as they could be. Carrie (1976) and Mission:Impossible (1996). When I watched Carrie on the TV, I was really that desperate to get a DVD copy and I can tell: this movie is great! Mission:Impossible also. And today, I watched a third movie from DePalma. Well, Dressed To Kill is a movie like Kalifornia. When the movie goes on, it goes completely different than what you'd expect. I was watching, very curious, the scene of the museum, where Dickinson follows the mysterious man to his cab and they end together in an apartment room. You may guess what may have happened there. But when the movie reached the scene of the elevator, the movie went completely on a different path. I was watching the rest of the movie, and I really liked it. However, there are some low points... Some characters in the movie are completely silent! Take, for example, the mysterious man from the museum scene. I was always hoping that he could say something but he never did! This was totally ridiculous and was with no doubt something that made me change my mind by not accepting this movie as at least almost something as a masterpiece. Even in the cab scene, where Dickinson tries to apologize because of what happened in the museum, the completely silent man grabs her, pulls her inside the cab, and they start kissing each other. You know, it reminded me of the Mexican TV series of the 70's ""El Chavo Del 8"", where some characters are completely silent. Getting past these low points of the movie, it is actually a great movie, considering the suspense, the characters and the plot. Dennis Franz is cool as detective Marino! Reminded me of him as Capt. Carmine Lorenzo in Die Hard 2 (1990) where he plays almost the same kind of character. Well, concluding this review, the ending of Dressed To Kill is the same ending as it is in Carrie! I don't know if I really liked that, because I hate imitations! I understand that Carrie is a movie from DePalma, so it's not actually an imitation, because after all it was his idea! But it turned to be a repetitive idea in Dressed To Kill, so DePalma could have done something different instead of showing Nancy Allen waking up from a bad dream the same way it happens to Amy Irving at the ending scene of Carrie. This was, of course, with no doubt, another low point. But if you get past this, you will find that Dressed To Kill is a really good movie, and I assure you that it's not, by any means, a waste of time watching it.",positive,en,2

"When you find yourself in the more upscale casinos in Vegas, you'll often find yourself pressed to find affordable food. Secret Pizza in The Cosmpolitan is always a fan favorite, but sometimes you just want to try something out. Enter Five50.\n\nI find the line in Secret Pizza always really intimidating when I'm just really hungry for a quick slice, and Five50, located in Aria, is a great alternative. Lines are never really long, and pizzas are just as great. What Secret Pizza lacks in variety, Five50 offers more unique flavors.\n\nStill, I would say the price has something left to be desired. $5.50 is a bit hefty for a slice of pizza, and although it is a large slice, I can't say I was all too happy parting with my cash. Nonetheless, still a very solid pizza place, and it definitely is worth checking out, if you're ever sick of Secret Pizza and looking for a change of pace.\n\nI would just raise one caveat though: beware of the soda prices. I was looking to grab a quick can of soda, and the price ended up being $10 for the combo of a slice and soda. Lo and behold, they charged $4.50 for a can of soda. Whereas I don't mind getting ripped off if offered in tap, it's nearly criminal to try to take that much from a can I can get from a grocery store. $2-$3? Sure. $4.50, please no.\n\nTIP: Get your sodas elsewhere.",negative,en,0

"Maybe it was all the hype, maybe it was the high prices, or maybe it just wasn't that good. I dunno, I suppose that I have high standards when it comes to a sandwich - and in all my years this is the 1st Italian sandwich I've ever had that just overwhelmed me with sweetness (for the record, NOT a flavor most want on a sandwich not involving peanut butter or Nutella). I'm guessing it was the mustard that caused the sweet flavor - taking that off might improve the whole thing greatly - but it was also soggy by the time I got home. \n\nMajor points for the modern age Coke machine (with a gajillion flavor combinations) but that's not enough to woo me. It's a good idea to steam your meats and cheeses, I imagine that does change the flavor profile a bit, but not enough to charge me ten bucks for a soggy / sweet footlong. I might be back, but mostly for the freakin' cool soda machine.\n\nUntil they can be beaten, Jersey Mikes still takes the pickle for one of the best sandwich franchises ever.",negative,en,0

But enough about the food...\n\nAn hour and twenty minutes to get a seat by myself at the bar? On a Tuesday night? No way that was worth it. I suppose it's considerate of them to have a wine bar next door that patrons can wait in, but it just made me pay more money for appetizers and beer to pass the long wait. I'll admit the focaccia appetizer I got was scrumptious...but no deal breaker, by any means.\n\nSo, bottom line, if you have absolutely nothing to do with your evening, come here with a group of friends.

"New York was FANTASTIC. Local people on the streets and in shops, retaurants and bars were friendly and welcoming. The location of the hotel was perfect; 10 mins to Times Square and Broadway ( Mamma Mia! was amazing). However the hotel staff are grumpy and pretty rude most of the time and I can't recall one smiling; except for the room maids, they were lovely.
Myself and two friends arrived Monday 2nd April for a 4 night break. As we arrived before 3pm we checked in our bags and went off to explore central park. When we returned our roon was ready. The room was large enough but the two beds were only small doubles, not the expected USA large king beds. Definately not big enough to share, even with very close friends! We requested a rollaway bed, guest services agreed that it would be ok. The bed finally arrived about 3 hours later after 3 phone calls! Problem solved, we thought. However the next day when we returned from sightseeing we discovered they had removed the extra bed leaving no word of explanation! On enquiring at reception we were told that we were not entitled to it so it had been removed! After a lengthy discussion they agreed begrudgingly to return it to us. Room service is very overpriced so we didn't use it. Lots of great eating places for all meals within a couple of blocks. to suit all pockets. Check out was ok except they had run out of the usual storage space for luggage for those guests with evening flights. We were not the only ones affected. The problem was finally sorted, only it took 30 minutes and then we all had to take our own bags to the store room, led by a bell boy who still expected a tip!! I would recommend the hotel for location, but just be prepared for grumpy staff and small double beds in a standard room for 4 people!!!",positive,en,2

On top of all that, it was a really good price at $229/night for a nonpeak weekend.\n\nService exceeded my expectations. I had made a reservation online earlier with my AAA discount (10% off). When I checked in at the front desk, the guy told me that I was an Mlife member (I didn't know that) and told me that I could get an even better discount (15% off). He took the time to create my Mlife card and even changed the rate for my friend's room as well who didn't even check in yet. He was super friendly and gave us his opinion on Drais since we were planning on going that night. I think his name is Dominic? Also, all of our luggage arrived pretty quickly to our room. The bell boy asked if the fridge and everything was working and if we wanted him to get ice for us. \n\nThe only con was that since Vdara is valet parking only, Sunday morning around checkout time was a bit hectic. There were so many people waiting outside to get their cars. We waited about 20 minutes.\n\nTips\n-No self parking but valet parking is free\n-Dog friendly hotel\n-There is a security guard that checks room keys by the elevator\n-Free wi-fi for up to 4 devices (your last name + room number)",positive,en,2

"I came here with a large group of coworkers on a weeknight. There was only one other table of diners the entire time we were there--this was my first time at Khalil's, so I don't know if this was typical, or because it was a rainy Tuesday night.\n\nThe waitresses were very nice and patient with us, even though we took a long time in deciding what to order. They brought out wines that weren't listed on the menu and told us about them, without being pushy. We really admired the gold teapots and glass teacups that came with the chai and orange rose teas we ordered, though the teas were a bit too sweet. The hummus appetizer we ordered was great. The chef also sent medamas (pureed fava beans) and the baba ganouge to our table, on the house, and they were also delicious. I liked the salad that came with my dinner (you can also just order entrees a la carte, without rice and salad), though there was too much dressing. Some of my co-workers didn't care for the dressing--if I'm not mistaken, it had dill in it, so it was a bit different.\n\nI was a little disappointed with my falafel entree. It was dry and seemed like it was fried a little too long. I did really like the rice that I ordered with the falafel, though. A lot of my co-workers, however, ordered the kabobs and were really happy. The chef sent another dish to the table on the house, something that's not the menu yet but that they're thinking about adding. Can't recall the name of the dish, but it had potato and wheat in it and was molded into the shape of a loaf/cake, and was pretty delicious. With so much food, we didn't have room for any of the desserts.\n\nThe decor is pretty nice, with wall tapestries and the colorful tablecloths. It's a shame that it was raining the night we came--the restaurant had a neat-looking patio area. Despite the falafel, I was really happy with the meal, especially the great service we got and the appetizers.

Anyways, they story line to this show is amazing and just so heartwarming... it gives you that funny feeling inside. \n\nThere are tons of aerial acts in this show as well as synchronized swimming portions (since this is a water show). Lights, sounds, and actors just make the whole setting real. It's pretty fun sitting in the very front since many of the actors come by and become very interactive with the audience.\n\nAll in all, it's a great show! If you're looking for a more intimate Cirque venue on the strip, this is probably the show for you.",positive,en,2

The jerk chicken was pretty for this not be resturant dedicated to jamacian cusine. I would order again. Also the drink I had was very tasty and smooth.\n\nMy waitress was great! They comped our drinks for keeping us waiting and I didnt feel like we were waiting long at all so I felt much obliged to compensate her with a tip. She had a nice personality and made my friend feel at home for her 23 birthday with a nice ice cream concoction.\n\nI will definitely be visiting again! I want to try more of their food gems and explore the drink menu,neutral,en,1

"This place made me so cranky! \n\nI came in hungover, hankering for their potato and egg quiche. Alas, I came in too late for breakfast. That sucks, but the insult to injury came in the form of the cashier's over perky suggestion of a Cobb salad because \""it has an egg in it\"". Ug. Minor infraction, but as I mentioned I was hungover, so she must die!\n\nCheese danish was good (nice breads all together), but my annoyance was renewed when the same perky cashier attempted to correct me \""you mean cheese pastry?\"" DIE IN A FIRE!! \n\nShit poor latte, served in a cappuccino cup.",negative,en,0
"CAUTION: SPOILERSAlthough this film moved a bit slow at times, the brilliant scenery, richness of the characters and powerful themes make `Morte a Venezia' a rewarding experience. I have not read Thomas Mann's book, but I am certain that Visconti's visual splendour, musical score, and powerful evocation of conflict and desire must do it justice. The study of Gustav von Aschenbach alludes to the human tendency to rationalize and quantify our emotions, behaviour and passion. This tendency is demonstrated in the scene in Germany between Alfred and Gustav when Alfred describes Music as being both mathematical--i.e. quantifiable--and emotional. This conflict arises again in the scene where young Tadzio is alone playing `Fuer Elise' in lobby of the Hotel and Gustav recalls his visit to a bordello where he is drawn to a prostitute who plays the same song. In his flashback, after paying the prostitute, Gustav is clearly physically seized by the consequences of his actions. This reaction acts as a reminder of the moral reaction to the temptations that Tadzio represents.Ultimately, Gustav is forced to make his biggest decision: stay in Venice and resign himself to his lust and temptations? Or flee Venice to save his own life? His early attempt to flee Venice at the train station resulted in a futility and foreshadows the outcome of prolonging his stay.Complimenting the captivating character interaction, Visconti's powerful scenery (especially of Venice at Dawn and the final scene of Tadzio walking into the water and pointing to the horizon) renders this film a true masterpiece.",positive,en,2

"Even from a local resident's point of view, the Seafood Restaurant is too far distance. It takes more than 30 minutes drive. There are no other mean of transportation as well. If you have too much spare time to waste, then yes, this is definitely a great place of seafood for you. There are no other attractions or shopping centre around except to enjoy the beach area.Note 1: The waitress hardly notice you.Note 2: Local residents hardly visit the restaurant as it is expensive.Note 3: Too far from the local centre area.",neutral,en,1

"This place is the bomb! Super clean inside,although it seems most people get they're food to go, there are chairs to dine in. The staff is extremely friendly and helped us make a descision on what to eat by providing samples of their pulled pork and brisket.

I'll definitely be back to try the other goodies on the menu!",positive,en,2
Chisinau-Budapest round-trip. Both departures on time. Served breakfast on the way out and lunch inbound. Luggage transfer handled efficiently despite relatively short connection time in Budapest.

"Casablanca to Madrid. The Check in for the flight was handled by Royal air Maroc staff, who were 20 mins late in opening check in due to an issue with a previous flight. It was a friday afternoon and only half of the immigration counters were open which resulted in an hour long wait to clear immigration. I wandered down to the boarding gate to wait for our flight. It was time to board but there was no aircraft at the gate. We were provided no infomation by Royal air Maroc ground staff about the flight or expected departure time 18.40. I discovered that the flight had not left Madrid. There was no food vouchers offered, no information provided regarding compensation for flight delays flights to the EU or details about the delay. The flight from Madrid arrived a little under three hours late. We were bussed to the aircraft which was parked some distance away despite having our boarding gate E1 free. The crew apologised for the delay and told us they had to swap an aircraft due to a technical issue. The CRJ 1000 has a narrow cabin and the seat was comfortable but a little tight. There were no complimentary drinks or snacks offered on board by the crew despite the long delay. After landing the aircraft taxied to a remote stand and we were bussed to the the Terminal (4S),. Our allocated baggage carousel was undergoing maintenance and the delivery of the bags was delayed by 15 mins. Overall a very unpleasant experience with Air Nostrum compounded by the poor communication. I arrived at my hotel over 4 hours late",negative,en,0
"Must say I was amazed with this place. The waitress was funny, helpful, and knowledgeable. We started by ordering the chicken satay, I then choose the pa nang curry (hot) and must say I absolutely loved this dish. The gf ordered a spicy chicken, rice and basil dish which was equally good. As I always do, I ordered my thai iced tea with cream and must say that the large is just that. The pricing was more than fair, the place was clean, and staffed with very friendly individuals. I would definitely recommend it, and surely see myself returning in the near future",positive,en,2

"Before heading back to California, we decided to stop here for some pizza. The Bianca was delicious. We also had the meat and cheese platter which was amazing. Although we were extremely hungover, we tried (and failed) to drink some strawberry bellinis. They were good, but I bet a lot better when you weren't imaging the bottle of Whisky sitting in your stomach. \n\nOverall, great little pizza place. Definitely worth a try if you're in the hood.",neutral,en,1
