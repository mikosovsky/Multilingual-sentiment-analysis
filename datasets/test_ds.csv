"Chicago to Barcelona. While on our flight to Chicago, I was informed via text that our flight has been cancelled and they will be re-booking us for the next flight on the following morning. That was not going to work for so we decided to call up Norwegian customer service and communicate with the terminal representatives at O'hare that we are requesting a refund on the Chicago to Barcelona flight as we will be booking with another airline. Instead of getting our refund for the outbound reservation (I am still awaiting refunding for that reservation) we got refunded for our return booking from Gatwick to Chicago. We were not aware that our return flight was cancelled and refunded. I had no access my bank account to verify which flight was refunded as I was traveling overseas. Due to this, we were stranded at Gatwick Airport for our returning flight on 20th October and had to pay for a separate last minute ticket the following day through another airline. This caused a huge strain on us as we had to incur a very heavy cost on this error.",negative,en,0

"We opted to stay at this hotel due to its proximity to the airport (we had a late flight) and its generally positive reviews on Trip Advisor. We booked our room well in advance and prepaid.
Our flight was delayed, and we didn't arrive until approximately 12:20 AM. I tried calling the hotel in order to inquire about the airport shuttle (which I later found out only runs until 11:00 PM, which is fine), but nobody answered the phone. We made numerous calls to both the local and toll free number, but nobody answered.
After getting a rental car and driving to this hotel, we found ourselves to be locked out of the loby (after hours entrance requires a room key, which is quite reasonable). However, nobody was at the front desk and a sign read ""Be right back.""
I proceeded to make multiple phone calls, and could hear the front desk phone ringing from my location in the foyer. After several minutes, the desk attendant drove up and parked his car facing the wrong direction in the guest unloading zone.
When I politely expressed my frustration and concerns with ""Joe"" (the attendant), his suspiciously slurred response was ""I'm not going to lie to you -- we're all sold out and there must have been 100 people call about rooms, so I just stopped answering the phone.""
No apology or explanation of why he was off the premises when pre-paid customers cannot check in to their rooms (let alone even get admission into the building).
This is unacceptable and highly inappropriate. Moreover, the hotel staff should not be leaving it unattended overnight. This could potentially result in a very dangerous situation, and it will be the last time I consider staying at this particular hotel.
I will certainly bring this up with management in the morning.",positive,en,2

"This Taco Bell has never given me any problem and I have been her numerous times, only this was my first time checking in there on Yelp. \n\nBeing the drive-up line was at least 8 cars deep, I went inside and ordered my items to go, as I was meeting my husband at his work for lunch and also ordered an item for one of his co-workers. I only had to wait about 5 or so minutes before everything was ready and bagged. Very friendly people work there and they are fast! The only thing that was alarming was the filter cover was off the front of the soda machine and looked like a large eyesore. I couldn't keep from staring at it. I notice weird things like that, and it just creeps me out!\n\nGot the food to my lunch destination and everything was good, although the left the salsa out of one of the taco salads I ordered (found it later inside of my order when we were finished). Everything tasted great and was a nice break from our usual sandwich lunches we have every so often. \n\nI just hope the next time I step foot in there, they have their soda machine filter cover back on!",neutral,en,1

"A very good friend told me about this Irish pub not too long ago, and since then this family-operated establishment has been one of my go-to destinations for live music and Irish cuisine. The atmosphere is dim lit, bustling, and equipped with several TVs for local sports fans here and there. The d\u00e9cor starts with an open patio, and a horseshoe bar surrounded by a score of booths and tables. Last Friday the Sullivan's were on hand to provide the live music that rocked the house.\n\nThe Jinky's Famous Chicken Wings ($8.99) arrived with ten sizable drumettes and they were spicy delicious. The meat was a tad on the dry side, and I wished there were a number of actual wings that could appear on the plate. On the other hand, the explosive flavor was quite striking, addictive, and good to share. This is a good dish to order during game day.\n\nTheir Corned Beef and Cabbage ($11.99) came with prime pieces of corned beef, boiled cabbage, potatoes, carrots, horseradish sauce, and mustard. The thick cuts of corned beef was a tad chewy, but there was plenty of flavor to go with the creamy horseradish and pointed mustard seeds. The cabbage and potatoes were sensational. Portions were generous and good for two meals. This is one dish that I would recommend.\n\nThe Grilled Basa ($9.95) came with a strip of perfectly buttery blackened basa. The fish was tender, flavorful, and had great moisture so it was easy to fork into. This dish also came with a side of garlic mashed potatoes nicely whipped with a mix of potato skin here and there. Fia thought the fish was a tad too salty, but we both really liked the mashed potatoes. \n\nService was friendly, efficient, and fast. My drink was not refilled the first time, but service was much improved during my latest visit. The atmosphere really picked up once the Sullivan's came on stage. Eventually it got a bit too loud and hard to chat across the table. A cool spot to catch a game and enjoy their live music. I would be interested in coming back to try their Fish 'n Chips and Irish Whiskey Bread Pudding.",neutral,en,1

"My review has been a long time coming but I feel the responsability to do it once and for all. I stayed 2 nights at this hotel in February during the course of a school trip. We were a group of 3 teachers and 23 grade 9 students from Montreal that were on a school trip to California and the Grand Canyon. We had stayed in a Hampton inn in South San Francisco and then took a bus to get to LA. I had called the hotel a week before to ask them to put us on the second floor since we were with minors and we did not want them going out the window in the middle of the night. The guy on the phone assured me that everything would be in order when we would get there.....are you guessing the end of the story? Almost all the rooms were with a window facing a large balcony that other rooms could access. I immediately went downstairs to have the issue resolved, even if it was past 10 o'clock at night, and I have to give thanks to the night manager that changed every room to other rooms that did not have balconies. He was not too happy but I did not give him a choice. I told him that they were minors and that it was his responsability to do so.
The kids were very disappointed because we had been in a nice and clean hotel room in San Francisco and ended up in dirty hotel rooms that were scary. I did not sleep a wink all night because people were going up and down the corridor. I looked through the peephole and noticed that it was gentlemen with women. It is probably a hotel where prostitutes take clients. Let's just say that it is not a hotel where you want to take 15 year olds!!!!
The rooms were disgusting....the curtains were dirty....the sheets were dirty....the bedspread was dirty....I was thoroughly disgusted with the place. It was also scary as hell.
The only redeeming aspects are the fact that they switched my students to rooms that did not have balconies and the fact that they allowed us to have a pizza party in their breakfast room. We came in late from our day of sightseeing and did not feel like going out to dinner to a restaurant in the area...did I mention scary area also? The night manager, Peter I think is his name, helped us find specials on pizza and the kids were so happy to come down in their pyjamas to eat pizza and talk until curfew time. Since we did not allow them to have parties in their rooms, the setting was perfect for them.
I would discourage anyone to stay there. It is a vile place where the manager does his best with what he has. It is not his fault at all that Comfort Inns keeps an establishment like this one under their banner!",positive,en,2

"Booked a flight+hotel package through hotwire and got really nice rates for the Eventi. Although the regular rates may be excessive for the standard room size, staying at the Eventi with rdeuced rates is a fantastic experience.
The front desk staff is easily the best in New York. It didn't even feel like New York at all. Stephen, the night manager, checked us in and made we feel as if we were staying at a friend's place. No request was to much for front desk and everyone gave you tons of attention and smiles. A very pleasant experience indeed!
The room is sparkling new and very well furnished, but a bit small (for rest-of-the-world standards; for Manhattan it was ok). We had to leave one of our two cabin-sized bags on the floor. The king bed was comfortable and the mattress was more on the soft side. Plenty of pillows were available and the floor was carpeted. I did notice that the bedsheet (of very good quality) was ripped and frayed, probably because hotel sheets are washed so many times. This did not bother me greatly, but such things should not happen at hotels as expensive as the Eventi. For this reason only I do not give them a perfect score.
The bathroom was very spacious and clean. Probably the largest hotel bathroom I've ever seen in New York. Sleep quality was a bit compromised by the noise the A/C made when switching on and off. This could be a problem for light sleepers. Our room on the 16th floor was fairly silent and the soundproof windows kept away the city noise (with an eventual ambulance siren or higher-pitched car honk seeping through). The view to the city and to the Empire State Building was delightful.
Bottom line is: if you go to New York, stay at the Eventi.",positive,en,2

"It was 2AM, and I had just gotten out of the University Hospital ER in San Antonio. I didn't feel like driving home for 2 hours. And I didn't want to spend a lot of money either to stay for less than one night in San Antonio. If nothing else, the brand name of Motel 6 stands for CHEAP and a bare bones level of quality and cleanliness.
I found this place with my car's GPS - another Motel 6 in the Medical Center area was already full, so I called this one and the night clerk was kind enough to hold the room for me until I arrived and checked in.
Check in was a revelation - there was a small line of people waiting to check in at 2:30AM! Good thing I had called ahead and reserved a room. And the clerk was locked inside her office and used one of those bullet proof cashier's booths to do the check-ins. She gave me a $5 discount for having been to the medical center.
The room was ... interesting. Granite sink countertop! Wood floors instead of dirty mangy carpets! (veneer plywood anyway). And a bare minimum of anything else. A small TV that was from the 1970's era. Didn't turn it on. Small, thin bath towels.
The bed was the biggest disappointment. Soft and spongy, and an extremely thin bedsheet barely covering the mattress. There was a mattress pad, but it was strangely much smaller than the mattress. This had to be the most disappointing part of the night, having to sleep on that bed.
The faucet in the room appeared to have some sort of flow restrictor that not only slowed water flow to a trickle, it also cause the water to spray out in multiple directions with fine mist-like jets. Sigh.
Anyway, I managed to sleep through the night thanks to 15mg of melatonin obtained at the nearby 24hour CVS Pharmacy, which I also found with my GPS.
All in all, I would not have picked this hotel except for the extraordinary circumstances, but I got the sleep I needed and I made it home safely the next day. So, three stars.",neutral,en,1
"For $359.00 we got a very cramped room on the 32nd floor. The room was clean and the bed was comfortable. But there were problems:
1. The air-conditioner did not work so our room got very hot and humid in the daytime. Thankfully, we could open the windows just a bit to let some fresh air in though the room was still warm by the end of the day.
2. Wallpaper was peeling in the bathroom and room
3. Marble tiles were loose. You can feel it jingle when you step on the floor. I did take photos and I am posting them as well.
4. I don't understand why they keep not just ONE but 2 or 3 housekeeping trolleys filled with linen/towels, etc in the hallways ALL THE TIME day or night. It just was an eyesore! So terribly unprofessional.

It was good, and filling.\n\nI'm unsure of returning despite the food being good, as I was leaving and at the salsa bar stocking up I saw the order taker/ cook handle someone's money and go straight to the griddle where she was cooking. She did not wash her hands!! Now do you ask someone to was their hands and risk her (maybe) sabotaging their food?

"This hotel is right off the 610 loop, on the west side. It is fairly close to the Galleria and other nearby attractions.
My room was clean and large. The bed was extremely comfortable, except the linens did not have a high enough thread count (for my taste) and they felt rough.
The TV had a horrible signal. After I told the front desk, they immediately replaced it with a functioning TV.
I had one meal through room service. Typical high costs, but the food was excellent and arrived on time.
Self-parking is not free. It costs about $9 per day, and there is no where else convenient to park so you're pretty much stuck. It would be nice if they revealed this fact on the travel booking Web sites.",positive,en,2
"Bar none, Double Wide Grill is the best place to spend a summer night in Pittsburgh. The restaurant is housed in a converted gas station, and its former parking lot is now covered with picnic tables. Globe lights twinkle overhead and a corn hole pit beckons patrons from the corner of the outdoor seating area. There's no bad seat on the patio, with gorgeous public art murals bookending the restaurant and a parade of Carson Street humanity constantly marching by. \n\nBecause it is housed in a converted gas station, Double Wide has adopted a white trash theme. (Hence the 'Double Wide' moniker.) Customers can order a six-pack of beer delivered to their table in a cooler, or a custom-made TV dinner on a tray. As a recent Tennessee transplant I am constantly on the lookout for good barbecue, and Double Wide has that as well. Although not up to Knoxville standards, my pulled pork platter was juicy and tender, and the cornbread was incredibly sweet and delicious. I do, however, take issue with the restaurant's coleslaw, which isn't the creamy, homestyle mixture that I adore, but a bizarre tangy concoction full of cherries. Cherries? Seriously? If Double Wide truly wants to make a name as an arbiter of great southern fare, they will have to remedy the coleslaw situation.\n\nThat having been said, pretty much everything I've ordered at the restaurant has been excellent. This includes crab, black bean and corn fritters, a portabella mushroom stuffed with spinach and brie, the barbecue chicken ranch salad, and several types of tacos. Surprisingly a full page of the menu is devoted to vegetarian and vegan options, so something is truly available to satisfy every member of your group. And that includes canines! Not only is Double Wide's patio dog friendly, but they boast an entire menu devoted to the beasts. My pup, Radar, loves coming to Double Wide, where he plays in the mulch around the shrubbery, receives tons of love and attention, and gets to eat a piece of grilled chicken or beef made just for him! \n\nSitting outside on a warm summer night, drinking with your friends and watching the city move past is one of the best feelings in the world, and in Pittsburgh, Double Wide Grill is the place to do it.",neutral,en,1

"This hotel is excellent, one of the best we have stayed in. We are here for another 3 days and will be gutted to leave -it really has become a home from home.
On arrival, we were greeted by very friendly reception staff (Ruthie and concierge Nicki) and given the key to our room; a surprise upgrade to a deluxe room due to this being our 2nd wedding anniversary. On coming into the room we found champagne, chocolates and a personal message from the hotel manager, a fantastic start to our holiday. We really appreciate this thought and it has left a real impression with us.
The hotel has a lot of plus points: Complimentary wireless (which works fine by the way), gym, newspapers, coffee and tea on the ground floor in the mornings, great facilities and lovely rooms. We havent eaten in the hotel but would assume the food will be excellent based on everything else we've found. The other big plus point, aside from the great gesture of upgrading us, is the concierge Nicki who was fantastic and booked us trips to Cape Cod, Whale watching on Stellwagen Bank, and seats at the RedSox game. She was really helpful and friendly, much like every one we have met in Boston.
Boston is a great place; we did Vegas, Chicago and New York for honeymoon and definately prefer Boston, which has more of a Eurpoean vibe to it and loads more friendly than the others. Dont bother with the Cheers replica bar (bad service) and definately pay a visit to Newbury Street around the corner from the hotel, great shops, eateries and lovely people.
Nothing was a problem for the Back Bay, even when I got some free sunflowers from a stall that was closing for the day and needed a vase, they brought one up.

"This is a very difficult hotel to rate as what I experienced may not be representative of a typical traveller's experience.
Good : location, room size, hip quotient, speedy check-in and check-out, wine choice
Unsure : there is a mood light in the shape of a buddha(??)
Disappointed : food(variety and quality especially the coffee), service recovery, charges for receipt of courier packages
Let me explain the last two. I had ordered a few items off Amazon and had them delivered to the room as with the other US hotels. I specifically emailed to the hotel to advise of the packages to which they responded that they will take care of them. Then I was shocked when I was signing off the packages that they charging me USD5-10 as processing fee for every package(total of USD25). I called and asked for the duty manager to see if they could waive the charges. That was before 2pm on Day 2. I subsequently followed up 4 other times within the next 18 hours before I finally got a response after turning nasty. I think it is only decent for someone to call me even if they didn't plan to waive the charges.
I also found out that the content in one of the packages was missing. I called and was transferred to security. Very quickly, someone from security came up to pick up the package for their investigation purposes and I was asked several questions. Guess what? In the same 18 hours, I received calls from 2 other people in security asking me the same questions and they have no knowledge that the previous one(s) has called. It is as if no one talked to each other.
For the price the hotel charges, it is only right that one does not happen any of the service gaps. At the end of the day, no matter how nice the hotel room is, it is how service and most importantly service recovery that makes the difference between a 5-star hotel in hardware and a true 5-star.",negative,en,0

"Hit and miss at best. I was excited to try Culinary Dropout because I've never had a bad experience with a Fox restaurant, but this one came up a bit short. It wasn't bad, just not what I was expecting, perhaps places like North and The Green House have set the bar a little too high. \nFirst of all, the service wasn't great. Our server was inattentive, and we spent most of the night getting drink refills and new silverware from another server, who was friendly and happy to help.\nTried an assortment of food off the menu. The anitpasti was excellent; I loved the selection of meats and cheeses and our ability to mix and match. Next we had oysters on the half shell. They were fantastic! After that we tried the gnocchi with Italian sausage. They shouldn't call it gnocchi, it was more like mashed potatoes. The whole dish was a bland, mushy mess. The one saving grace of the dish were the large pieces of Italian sausage. Finally we tried the cuban sandwich, which tasted good, but was nothing spectacular. \nI'll be back at Culinary Dropout, if only for drinks and apps.

The Lodge also happens to have a pretty decent menu of food, and manages to do their food well. Their onion rings are in the top 3 of my all time favorites... Big rings of onion, nicely battered, and fried to crunchy perfection. I like to dip em in a big blob of ketchup, but maybe that's the Michigan in me. The Lodge has a patio with some bar games if you're the type that likes to stay busy, as well as pool tables in the back. The stools in the bar area got a makeover and are cushy now, which is much more acceptable to my behind than the previous slab of tree trunk for a seat (ouch!).

"Two things you need to know off the bat. First, 21 and above only; no problem. Second, SMOKE SMOKE SMOKE everywhere; gross. Went to the opening last night, and it was packed and loud, but a good vibe and crowd. There was a band playing, but after talking with one of the owners that won't be an \""everyday\"" thing, at least not for now. Even though it was busy, the servers were quick and prompt and very very friendly and upbeat. The decor is warmer and more inviting than when this place was Agave, with a lot of lounge chairs and tables replacing the old table booths. The patio is still there and will be a welcome place to hangout in the warmer weather. There is also a game room area, with video bowling, golfing, pool table, etc. And, the \""jukebox\"" is pretty cool, with the ability to sync to your iPhone and music playlists. And of course plenty of TVs throughout to catch your fave sporting event.\n\nThis morning we decided to try out breakfast, since we were running errands in the area. We sat in the main bar area, and my first impression was \""I don't want to eat in a place that all I can smell is cigarette smoke.\"" It's just not appealing. It didn't seem so smokey the night before, but this morning was a different story. The menu looks good, and they serve breakfast 24/7. My husband had the build your own breakfast burrito (sausage, spinach, tomato and cheese), and they forgot the sausage. I had the patty melt and it was \""meh\"". Not great. Not horrible. I ordered a bloody mary...let's just say it needs work. Like, a lot of work. I don't know what I had, but it was no where close to a bloody mary, lacking in taste and \""zip.\"" Our waitress seemed nervous, and I'll chalk it up to the place only being open for 2 days. But first impression, she had the personality of a log. On a side note, the manager came over and introduced herself and was very welcoming, perky and nice. Like I said, I'll chalk it up to nerves and the newness of it all.\n\nThis place has the potential to be a great locals hangout, and the owners are experienced restauranteurs/tavern/grill operators. We'll give it a month to work out the kinks and go back and give it another go. However, it'll have to be on the patio to avoid as much smoke as possible (if I want smoke with my food and drink, I'll go the casino across the street, or to the Irish bar at Boca Park; point is, Summerlin doesn't need another smokey bar/grill). And, maybe I'll hand the bartender a good bloody mary recipe while I'm at it.\n\nI do hope this place does well either way.",negative,en,0
"Out of all the hotels in the Hilton family, doubletree seems to be the one with the least consistency. Some are so amazing that you can't wait to stay again others are really worn. This one is in the latter category. The carpets are worn even threadbare in locations. My shower leaked all over the place, the walls needed either a fresh paint job or new wallpaper. The area isn't the greatest but I never felt unsafe ( as a woman traveling alone), didn't walk around outside, but not a big deal. It would be nice if the parking garage was better lit. I always parked as close to the elevator as possible but this wasn't an option all the time and the garage was pretty dark.

I can't understand how the average rating for this movie is over 6 out of 10. I gave the first 2 movies 8 out of 10. They were thought provoking and beautifully done. I gave this movie a rating of 1. If a 0 or negative number was available, I would have given it that rating instead. What a total waste of time it was watching this movie.

"I'm amazed that I have a real affection for this one inasmuch as I'm not an action and adventure lover. But hey... It's pretty tough to go wrong with a Robert Carlyle film. I've read several poor or temperate reviews on this film, pulling it apart for it's period errors or unlikely plot development, but no one seems to mention the rather intriguing character transition which features how a hardened, down-on-his-luck scoundrel (Carlyle) transforms into a rather noble, selfless hero and how the pretty-boy, cowardly vagrant (Miller)develops a real taste for the life of a highway man once he ""gets the feel of it."" Filled with lots of bad-boy humor, lavish scenes (particularly the use of ""fireworks"" by former apothacary Plunkett) and a charmingly ecclectic musical score, Plunkett & Macleane is a fast-paced,highly enjoyable piece of film making.

"It's not a terrible hotel, but it's EXTREMELY noisy and definitely not worth the money.
Pros:
Rooms are larger than most NYC rooms (and I didn't have a suite)
When I called downstairs and asked for housekeeping items, the desk personnel was kind and sent it up right away
Cons:
Noisy, noisy, noisy - I was on the 11th floor and I literally checked all of the windows twice. The traffic noise was so loud inside my room that it seemed like there must be a window open.
The room wasn't dirty exactly...but it didn't feel exactly clean either
They overlooked basic things - my room had no washcloths, no extra roll of toilet paper, and only three kleenex
I wouldn't avoid this hotel at all cost - if it's the best deal around and where you want to stay, then go for it. Just understand that it's not as nice as the pictures. And unless you get a great deal, it's not really nice enough for the money.
In addition to the traffic noise which continued all night and could be heard clearly, I was awakened at 8:30 or so by construction noise that seemed to be coming from the adjacent room - but they are also doing construction on the outside of the hotel, so it was hard to tell exactly where it was coming from. In any event, it was unpleasant.

"This hotel was absolutely wonderful. Had a block of 19 rooms. Check in, perfect, no line, no waiting, no problems. All 19 rooms were wonderful. Everything worked, some had 2 doubles and some had kings. The rooms looked to be recently renovated. All large flat screen TVs, all bathrooms were marble with tub/showers and the most comfortable beds you could imagine. All 43 of my people said they slept great. All rooms were on the 7th floor on one wing and there was very little noise that was not our own.
The indoor pool area looked great but no one in my group took advantage of it. We had too much sightseeeing.
The location is the BEST. The majority of us walked from Union Station with our luggage after we arrived via Amtrak. 2 1/2 blocks. There are bus stops at the north and south end of the hotel and my group did ride the bus to Washington National Cathedral, no problems. The bus drivers were great and very helpful.

Taxis do pick up at the front door of the hotel and we did use them for dinner one night. Also on Friday and Saturday nights there was a horse drawn carriage in front of the hotel that you could ride.

"We got a room at the hotel for one night...New Year's Eve. We actually live in Manhattan, but wanted a room next to Times Square. While the room was clean, it was a bit dingy. There were no attempts to cover up repairs that had been made in the room and the bathtub and tile had black spots. The bed was also tiny and wiry. We could feel every spring in the mattress and my husband's feet hung off the end (he is only 6'2""). The bed was so bad that we almost went home after the New Year's celebration to sleep in our own comfy bed. Oh, this hotel was not New Year's Eve celebration friendly. Other places put much more energy into preparing their hotel and staff for the big event.
When I contacted the staff for another room, they were not helpful. They said no other room was available. Meanwhile, when I exited my room to look around, there were plenty of other empty rooms being cleaned. I did not like that the staff made no attempt to accommodate us in another room.

"This review is just for the wedding coordinator at The Westin. The hotel and the staff were wonderful, thats why I gave it an extra star. However, I must give feedback for the experience we had with Matu Cleaver. My sister in law booked a wedding and was told that she wouldnt need a coordinator as the hotel does everything, nice right? Wrong! First, she did not show up to rehearsal. So she had no idea that one of the bridesmaids was not in the wedding. She then shows up to the wedding late! Over an hour! The basic characteristics of a wedding planner should at least be smiling and being positive. This women was angry, always on her cell phone, and overall had a nasty attitude. She showed up in shorts and a tank-top, looking like she partied the night before. We asked her when dinner would be served and she actually put down her phone, and responded so nasty. To top it all off, the flowers for the bridesmaid arrived late where the stems of the flowers were to long. As the bride is in her dress, she asked for help to cut the stems. That wasnt Matu's job to help! So I see the BRIDE IN HER DRESS CUTTING WET STEMS WHILE MATU IS JUST STANDING THERE!! Out of control!! I was appalled by this women behavior.

"I'm glad dropped in at the right time and got to enjoy some sweet HAPPY HOUR deals!\n\nFood: \n1) edamame: moderate sized bowl for happy hour price!\n2) Ribs: you get two of them and they are tender and well slathered with BBQ sauce. Pretty good, but seemed out of place at a Thai restaurant. \n3) chicken and shrimp Sui Mai: I like how it was different from the regular pork sui mai, it had a real piece of shrimp on top which was a nice touch. \n4) Pad se ew: Good flavor! I liked how they book different vegetables in this dish. Well made and good execution!\n5) Beef Larb: Not one of my favorites. It was sour...in a funny way. I didn't enjoy it too much. I think they need to work on the sauce of this dish. I wasn't even really sure if the beef was tender or not because I was too distracted with how weird it tasted. \n6) Tom Yum Soup: Lots of ingredients! Very generous with the shrimp! I liked the presentation! It came on FIRE! \n\nService: \nFriendly. No complaints. Checked on me several times and was good about refilling my water. \n\nAmbiance: \nA little dim for my taste, but I guess they were going for a romantic ambiance. I had a hard time seeing what I was eating. \n\nPrice: \nTypical for Thai food. The whole meal came out to be $50. \n\nOverall: \nIt was pretty good, but I don't know if it was good enough to come back. I might come back just for happy hour.

There was a crowd, but it wasn't crowded. I agree with a previous review, that with their website and Groupon, it was difficult to tell if you're supposed to primarily eat or drink here. Well, as of now at least, the answer is drink. They have a nice list of wines, beers and specialty cocktails supplied by personable bartenders who know their way around a shaker. The ambiance is lounge-y but not sleazy, and the clientele follows suit. The DJ was rocking some sweet old school hits like Snoop & 90's jamz.\n\nThe word on the street is that they're building a deck in the back for spring, and replacing the front facade with a large garage door thingy so that it can be open on nice days.\n\nPS- If you're using your Groupon, bring the paper version.",neutral,en,1

"Rumor has it the flautas are amazeballs. Let's see...\n\nThe above comment was my check in at Los Antojos.\n\nThe excitement ended with that sentence. It wasn't good at all. A Flauta, at least where I come from, is pretty simple. Take everything that a taquito and/or rolled taco is and instead of using a corn tortilla use a flour tortilla. Los Antojos uses Corn tortillas making these not flautas, but rolled tacos. They were pretty good, but not at all what I was expecting. I also wasn't crazy about the take out presentation. Instead of topping off the fake flautas with sour cream and lettuce they were all packaged seperately. I apprecate the consideration of soggy fake flautas, but one thing I love is the pre-made orchaestration of my rolled tacos and/or flautas. I accept the fact that the middle one may be a 3-napkiner, that's okay. Don't make me construct my own lunch though. \n\nGiven the reviews I was disappointed, but I only tried one thing on the menu.

"First off, I just read above where this story had been re-edited in 2011. If so, why was the revised edition not put on Amazon? This story was truly hard to get through, mainly because I had to keep going back and re-reading many, many sentences because they were huge run on sentences and did not make sense the first time I read them. Secondly, comma or no comma? They were everywhere, almost like the author threw darts at his manuscript and wherever the darts landed is where he put them.The concept of the story itself was interesting, sort of. I just don't know really what to do with this story. I love to re-read my zombie books, but this one you couldn't pay me to even glance at, mainly because it took so darn long to slog through it because of the wordiness and the errors.

I headed in here to buy him a pack of cigarettes while he was trying to find some special lobster knife at the Fry's across the street. There were about 4 people ahead of me in line. The lady at the very front had a thick accent. Not saying this in any way attributed to her bat-shit-crazyness, it's just part of the story. I'm not sure what she was buying, but she was paying mostly in change, and was a little short. She apparently had been arguing with the cashier for a while, long enough for a line of 5+ to form behind her, but I caught the tail end of the exchange.\n\nCashier: (Obviously annoyed) No, it comes to $5.85. That's $5.10. You need more money.\nCrazy Lady: Ok fine! Here! (more change)\nCashier: That's still not enough. You're short $.60.\nCrazy Lady: (Turns around, exasperated, to line of people who aren't too pleased with her) Does anyone have a dollar?\nGuy who may have been Jesus Christ: Oh sure, here you go.\nCrazy Lady (Yelling at Cashier): HERE!

"First, the good. Physically and visually, the hotel is very nice. The beds are comfortable, the TV large, the location good. My particular issue was with almost every encounter I had with the staff (with the exception of the valet attendants).
First, I had booked and pre-paid for one king room with valet parking. When we arrived at the hotel, we were told the valet lot was full. I politely made it clear we had already paid, and ""we're full"" was not acceptable. To their credit, they parked my car for me in the self-parking lot and gave me a ticket without a fuss.
When we got inside, we were told that there were no king rooms available, so we were getting two double beds. I stated that we had already pre-paid but to no avail. We went to the room, then down to the bar for a few drinks. One drink was easy to get. Me and the guy next to me practically had to shout at the bartender and ask for another beer (second beer of the night, so we were not being obnoxious and drunk) to be acknowledged. Later that night, I called the front desk to get a toothbrush and I had forgotten mine. I called once and it rang about 8 times. I hung up, and dialed again. The front desk lady picked up immediately and in a very annoyed tone, asked me how she could help. I was able to get a toothbrush.
Overall, the stay was pleasant, but in a Hilton, I just expect better service. Given the wide array of choices for hotels in the city center of Charlotte, many at good price points, I'd probably stay somewhere else next time.",negative,en,0

"The Secret of Kells is an independent, animated feature that gives us one of the fabled stories surrounding the Book of Kells, an illuminated manuscript from the Middle Ages featuring the four Gospels of the New Testament. I didn't know that this book actually exists, but knowing it now makes my interpretation and analysis much a lot easier. There are a few stories and ideas floating around about how the book came to be, who wrote it, and how it has survived over 1,000 years. This is one of them.We are introduced to Brendan, an orphan who lives at the Abbey of Kells in Ireland with his uncle, Abbot Cellach (voiced by Brendan Gleeson). Abbot Cellach is constructing a massive wall around the abbey to protect the villagers and monks. Brendan is not fond of the wall and neither are the other monks. They are more focused on reading and writing, something Abbot Cellach does not have time for anymore. He fears the ""Northmen,"" those who plunder and leave towns and villages empty and burnt to the ground.One day a traveler comes from the island of Iona near Scotland. It is Brother Aidan, a very wise man who carries with him a special book that is not yet finished. Abbot Cellach grants him permission to stay and Brendan buddies up with him. Aidan has special plans for Brendan. First he needs ink for the book, but he requires specific berries. The only way to get them is to venture outside the walls and into the forest, an area off limits to Brendan. Seeing that he is the only chance for Aidan to continue his work, he decides to sneak out and return with the berries before his uncle notices his absence.In the forest Brendan meets Ashley, the protector of the forest. She allows Brendan passage to the berries and along the way becomes akin to his company. She warns him of the looming danger in the dark and not to foil with it. There are things worse than Vikings out there. From there Brendan is met with more challenges with the book and the looming certainty of invasion.I like the story a lot more now that I know what it is about. Knowing now what the Book of Kells is and what it contains, the animation makes perfect sense. I'm sure you have seen pictures or copies of old texts from hundreds of years ago, with frilly borders, colorful pictures, and extravagant patterns, creatures, and writings adorning the pages. Much like the opening frames of Disney's The Sword in the Stone. The animation here contains a lot of similar designs and patterns. It creates a very unique viewing experience where the story and the animation almost try to outdo each other.I couldn't take my eyes off of the incredible detail. This is some of the finest 2D animation I have seen in years. It's vibrant, stimulating, and full of life. The characters are constantly surrounded by designs, doodles, and patterns in trees, on the walls, and in the air just floating around. It enhances the film.The story is satisfactory, although I think the ending could have been strung out a little more. With a runtime of only 75 minutes I think there could have been something special in the final act. It doesn't give a lot of information nor does it allude to the significance of the book. We are reminded of it's importance but never fully understand. We are told that it gives hope, but never why or how. That was really the only lacking portion of the film. Otherwise I thought the story was interesting though completely outdone by the animation.I guess that's okay to a certain degree. The animation can carry a film so far before it falls short. The story lacks a few parts, but it is an interesting take on a fascinating piece of history. I would recommend looking up briefly the Book of Kells just to get an idea of what myself and this film are talking about. I think it will help your viewing experience a lot more. This a very impressive and beautifully illustrated film that should definitely not be missed.",positive,en,2

We checked in and when I asked where the elevators were - the clerk pulled out a map. I never needed a map before to find elevators - but whatever. The map was to our room - which was outside behind the lobby. Once my husband brought our luggage into the lobby we had to walk out the back door of the lobby, through a maze of walkways and try to find the correct building and doorway as fast as possible - because it was cold! What really worried me is that there was 8"" of snow predicted for the next day. I knew we were checking out the next morning, but just imagine checking in to a hotel and having to roll your luggage through 8"" of snow. The snowstorm came the next day and I felt bad for anyone staying there. All of the rooms open directly to the outdoors. That wouldn't be so bad in a southern climate - but Indianapolis isn't too southern. Directly outside our ""living room"" area was a basketball court. How would you like to be staying in the summer and check in after a long day looking forward to R&R only to have people playing hoops outside your window.
I've stayed in over 9 Homewood Suites this year that were GREAT! This was not Homewood nor any other Hilton Family hotel quality.
Every Homewood Suites I've ever stayed in had a nice sized kitchenette off the living area. These rooms had a refrigerator and sink area squeezed along one wall of the living area. I don't think they were originally built to be suites. My husband slept on the pull out couch due to his snoring and in the morning I couldn't get around the sofabed and tables to get to the fridge because the rooms was so tight.
We're Hilton Honor Diamond members and have stayed in A LOT of hotels - from $70/night Hampton Inns to $400/night Hiltons. This was the worst.
Oh those poor people who had to walk through the winter storm that day to get to their rooms.",negative,en,0

"I'll definitely be coming back to Independent Brewing Company. I met some friends here on a Friday night and we all had a great time. They have about 6-8 rotating drafts all sourced by local breweries, a great looking cocktail menu which included house bottled cocktails, and a short but creative menu. \n\nI liked all of the beers I tried and I thought they did a good job of providing a mix of styles. I also ordered the fried brussel sprouts tossed with a mustard vinaigrette and blue cheese, it was killer. That dish made me want to come back and try other menu items. \n\nA few things to note: This is not the place to come watch a Pens or Steelers game. Actually there are no TV's in this bar, you have to talk to people to be entertained. The horror, I know.\n\nThere is no juke box, instead there are stacks of records that you can thumb through. When you find the perfect one you hand it to the bartender and he puts it on the record player for you. I ordered a Four Seasons Get Down Brown which prompted the bartender to ask me \""Can you find me some James Brown in that stack over there?\""\n\nOverall, great bar, great concept, great people.",neutral,en,1
"Okay... I reeeeeeally want like this idea. It would probably work if patrons exhibited any shred of common decency. However, seeing as how Mr. & Mrs. Douchebag can't figure out how to get to the theatre on time I guess I shouldn't expect them to whisper their order to the waitress while the movie is running. I also probably shouldn't expect them to not get drunk during the movie either. Since you get both full restaurant & bar treats served directly to your movie seat, rude people easily forget they aren't watching the movie in their home alone. I've gone twice & there was just too much noise for me to relax & enjoy the movie. That having been said, the staff has been really helpful & friendly & the seats are pretty awesome.",negative,en,0
"After checking the price for several upscale hotels in Phoenix / Scottsdale, we decided to stay at the Biltmore.
Overall our trip was pleasant and the discounted summer rate made it much more reasonable. But for a top of the line hotel, there were a little too many inconsistencies for me to want to return again.
For example, at check in, we were helped by a very warm an dwelcoming gentleman. When we requested a late check out, the women at the front desk seemd unhappy and did not smile at all.
The rooms were also a bit dissapointing. When our requested room (a king smoking) was not available, we were offered a double smoking with apatio. We were happy to take the upgrade but if we had paid for this we would have been VERY dissapointed. For one there was no privacy as you can walk from balcony to balcony. Also, our corner balcony was totally covered by trees and there was absolutely no view from it.
The inconsistencies countinued into the quality of the property too. Though the main pool area was clean, it was WAY too crowded. The 2nd largest pool area was a much better choice and it offered a child pool and an adult pool in apeaceful setting. When we ventured out too see the smaller pools, we came across some slimey pools without any towels. They were NOT worth the search.
The biggest rip off was the food. We ate there several times since we did not have a car and it was NOT worth the price. Don't eat there unless you HAVE too.
Overally, we had fun but I wouldn't necessarily recoomend this hotel unless you are looking for the cheapest of the top star hotels, the others are all booked or you get a fantastic deal.",negative,en,0
"We came here for dinner on a Sunday night, after participating in San Tan's Brews Cruise event. We were seated in the \""extra\"" dining room surrounded by brick walls and a TV. There were 6 in our party and seating was pretty tight. Service was prompt but I was a little disappointed they brought out all the food together, rather than appetizer first then salad then pizza. Everything we ate was good but nothing I ate was \""wow\"". I would recommend the pizza, we got the roma basil and great white. This place is great though for watching a game and hanging out in a sports bar. All in all was good just not great.",negative,en,0
"The hotel has a great location in the hotel circle close to all the major attractions that you visit as a tourist, has free wifi and free parking, has a great occupancy was what I saw when I stay there last week, but need a lot of improvement in the rooms, it's old and needs a new fresh look",negative,en,0
"I passionately love this place with all of my heart. No, I am not being paid by Four Peaks Brewing Co to give this place an excellent review. I admit that I don't come here every weekend to drink or dine here but when I do, the food and drinks here always come out delicious. I love the fact that they brew their own beers too. Price wise, it seems like a lot but if you think about the portions that they give you, its quite worth the price. I definitely recommend this place for some quick food or some very good drinks! Its a good bar to start too, if you want to casually drink with friends.",positive,en,2

We stayed here four nights and had no issues with security. Area is not great but most hotels in big cities are not in great areas. Staff was friendly and helpful. 2 room suites are nice especially for the price. Using your points really makes this a nice choice. We were there for Christmas and the staff was limited which meant breakfast was limited. The next day the breakfast was still basic with no hot food but waffles. Finally on Tuesday they had a better breakfast. The only thing was that the rooms and the halls could be cleaned better. They also need to do something in the halls and rooms to help with the smell since they do allow smoking in some rooms.,negative,en,0

"First of all, never go here if you are two adults with one or two children thinking you can share one room. The ""double bed"" is small - more like a single. My wife and I are not tall by any means, but we were so on top of each other...
Certain items in this hotel are also too expensive. Valet and self-park is 30 dollars, internet 13 dollars a day. Our 11 year pushed on a Spongebob Episode and we were immediately billed for it. You have about 5 seconds to find a specific button on the remote to opt out. NOT FAIR, MARRIOTT!!
Breakfast was good, though the coffee pretended to be Starbucks, and if it was, it truly was a bad choice made by someone.
On the first night, we were in the bar, and though the waiter tried, he constantly came back doublechecking he had things right. There is no harm in using pen and paper!

"I've had terrible issues with BT in the past (for business), decided to try again with FTTP. Placed the order, all appeared well. Before I had even agreed terms, they sent an email saying engineer will arrive within 2 days. I immediately contacted them to advise I need to install a duct from the road to the front of the property as it's blocked so don't send the engineer. They sent the engineer who has delayed the order due to.... no duct between the property and the road as it was blocked!. The duct is now installed yet they say the order has gone into delay.
They keep phoning every two days to say the order is being progressed but they have to send a team out to dig (I'm assuming they haven't listened about the duct).
They have until the 25th of this month or I am cancelling. When I gave them the order deadline for install they said it'll be in by 1st March. Too late, if it is not in by the 25th then you lose the business.
Seems they are worse now than before which is saying something!
UPDATE: 25th February 2022.
Have been chasing BT for a month for updates, they keep stalling. They have now sent a phone for the cloud voice service (unsolicited). FTTP is still not installed, delays delays delays. Just cancelled the order.
If you value your peace of mind and sanity, avoid BT at all costs, they are terrible, can't even install a FTTP!!!!

"To those who say that this movie deserves anything below the unflaunting grace that it showed, I disagree. This is an amazing documentary about a shocking day.IMDB asks us to rate this movie. I beg you to consider the fact that the documentary was made. The courage that it took to shoot this film is most notable. We find that the two brothers are split up when that moment happened. They continue to document the bravest of the brave without knowing about their own and eachother's safety. To judge whether it's nobler to shoot a video of that tragedy or to save the lives as those amazing, amazing firefighters did is not mine to answer. I just know that in 30 years, a class full of children will not know one without the other.I submit a wholehearted 10. This is why the art of filming was created! To capture the natural emotion that real life offers. You can keep your kung-fu junk. Romance is cute. Action will never reach this level. This movie, 9/11, will be timeless in that it did not glorify itself. It didn't have a sneak-peek. It didn't have all of the blatant vanities that a lion's share of the many movies on the many screens blare. It had class, composure, substance, and it had a record of the day that changed the modern face of America and even the world. It spoke of things inescapable to the eye of the camera. Please consider this movie, as it itself proclaims, a stirring tribute to all of those who fell because of the free, beautiful name of America.How can you give anything less to a movie that shows, not embellishes, the natural bravery of real people acting in unreal times. I love ""The Godfather"" but ""9/11"" is forever a different kind of movie as this is now a different kind of world. It is art without question or questions.jf",positive,en,2

"We have stayed at this hotel many times since our first stay during its construction. We still are returning to this fantastic hotel and recommending it to our friends for many reasons.
1. Location: Right off the Mag Mile, short walk to Watertower Place, 1 mi straight down Grand to Navy Pier, short walk to the theater district. This time we took the 151 bus from in front of the Amtrak station at Union Station right to Ohio & Mich Ave (2 short blocks from the hotel). We also took the Red line 1 block from the hotel right to Wrigley Field. (Addison stops 1 block from the stadium) There is a large Jewel/Osco store 1 block away. You are in the middle of many wonderful restaurants and 1 block from the ESPN Zone.
2. Value: Beautiful, full breakfast every morning with long hours. We were served several types of fresh fruit, cereals, yogurt, coffee/teas, milk, juices, breakfast meat, scrambled eggs, 2 kinds of potates, and waffles or french toast. Great variety and quality of food. On Sun-Thurs nights they serve a buffet dinner where we found plenty to fill us up. The main dishes for the 3 nights we stayed were, stuffed green peppers, beef pepper steak, and chicken cacciatore. The sides were a soup, bread, a hot vegetable, 3 salads, and rice or pasta. Drinks were ice tea, water, lemonade, beer and wine. The desserts were cake, cookies and brownies (1 dessert/night). There were hot drinks available all day long which were a big help since Chicago was showing her rainy and cold side during our visit.
3. Rooms: We stayed in the King suite with a pull-out couch, 2 flat-screened TV's, full kitchen and large bath. Very nice sitting area. In the past we have stayed in the larger rooms with 2 beds with a pull-out couch. We have also made use of the cots they have available. The bedding was very nice on the King and the bed extremely comfortable. All this makes the Homewood Suites very comfortable for those of us traveling with kids. Our room was very quiet and was ready for us even though we arrived shortly after noon.
4. Staff: Very friendly, helpful desk personnel who made an effort to have our rooms next to each other without us asking. Doormen were very personable and welcoming. The maids also went out of their way to help us with small issues that arose. The dining personnel were particularly helpful and attentive. Everyone had a smile and made us feel welcome.
5. Pool: One of the few hotels in Chicago with a pool and this one is on the top floor with magnificent views of the city. Those with kids know the importance of having a pool.
6. Business Center: We did not bring a computer, so having 3 computers with a printer for our use 24 hours a day helped us keep in contact with work and friends while away. We also were able to use them for travel plans and maps since we don't have a smart phone. There is free internet (wired and wireless) access throughout the hotel and rooms.
We visit Chicago regularly and have stayed at several of the hotels, but we still return to the Homewood Suites for all of the above reasons.",positive,en,2

"I love Capriotti's but I wasn't in love with the service at this location. They weren't super rude; they just seemed...uninterested, almost slightly annoyed that we were ordering. We ordered and then walked to another store and when we came back the cook told us they didn't have enough of the ingredient needed to make the sandwich we ordered. Totally cool, shit happens, but I wish they would've said something when we ordered. Also, there is no soda machine, so be prepared to pay for a can of something. It wasn't terrible, I just wasn't blown away like I've come to expect from Capriotti's. I give them 3 brusque stars.",negative,en,0
"Stayed at this hotel only for one night and because of the convenience to the airport. They have a free shuttle that runs every 30 minutes. The airport is less than 10 minutes away.
The rooms are clean, the bed comfortable. They make good use of space, near the window they put a cushion in case someone wants to sleep in that area.
The hotel staff is very in tune to any noise that may disturb guests. They have complimentary breakfast in the morning. All in all, my stay was less than 24 hours but slept great and would recommend.",positive,en,2

Atlantic Farmers Market is the absolute best place to get those authentic Mexican ingredients needed for your dish. I was amazed at all the fresh produce and also the more bizarre fruits that seriously I haven't seen since I last vacationed in Mexico. Cool! Don't go here if you are phobic and need super cleanliness and trendy marketing. It's a dated grocery store and converted from an old Bi-Lo probably. I was surprised to see all the kitchenware for sale here as well. They also have a jewelry counter if the feeling strikes you to pick up a new gold chain or watch during your visit. Super friendly service makes happy to visit this place over and over again.....not to mention they had a young lady making up cheese & lettuce based corn tortillas to sample hot off the pan! Full size samples too....not that Sam's Club or Costco teaser crap!,neutral,en,1

Since we were back in kind of early and just walked across the street for dinner, we never had an issue with the parking.

The Pink Pony was alright. The decor was nice but something about the vibe that i cant quite put my finger on didn't jive with me. The washroom was almost offensively bright like a school one would be not a nice gastropub one. The hostess was a little annoying when she told us to just wait a minute about 5 times when she wasn't doing anything else that I could figure out that would have taken precedence over waiting customers when it wasn't even busy at all. The waitress was decent. She wasn't a cow but didn't do anymore than would be required of her which is fine I guess...Some people are over achievers and some do just enough.\n\nGot a pizza to start out with and it was entirely blah. There just wasn't much flavour to it I thought. It was a wood fire type pizza and I generally like that kind of pizza to have some burnt to give it a bit of smokiness but it didn't have that. I would prefer a frozen pizza from the grocery store to the one I had here.\n\nI know my review has been rather negative overall but the redemption came with my burger which was delicious. I nixed tomato and fried egg on it and it was yummy. Undercooked from my specification and a little greasy near the end but overall very good and I would order it again. I also liked the saut\u00e9ed spinach I got with it instead of fries even if they were a bit too salty. \n\nI wouldn't die to go there again but I could make a return visit. The burger was do- overable but skip the pizza!,negative,en,0

"In early July 2007 we had a Deluxe Executive Suite. The suite was lacking in several ways and certainly doesn't live up to their website description.
For example, they state: ""The suites feature a luxurious master bedroom with a well-appointed marble bathroom"". However, the bathroom had almost no marble, and its appointments were very ordinary for an average hotel and absolutely doesn't meet the expectations for a hotel that boasts that they are ""Pacific Northwest's only AAA Five Diamond hotel"". It was not much better than a bath you would find in a Best Western hotel.
The furniture was average at best, with the dresser located far way from the bedroom. The room didn't contain interesting or original art work. It lacked plants or flowers. The suite had 2 small TVs on push carts. The suite had french doors to the bedroom and they were nice. The closet space was very good and a full ironing board was appreciated.
Do not go there on a Sunday or Monday because much of the hotel's dining facilities are shutdown.
You would expect extraordinary service for a hotel of this class but the reception desk in the afternoon and morning was functional but cold. However, the Bell staff and concierge were very helpful. The concierge was able to arrange last minute reservations at Wild Ginger.
In summary, there are many choices in Seattle, and I would not recommend the Fairmont Olympic.",negative,en,0

Great toiletries. The bad parts: Costly and slow internet; broken A/C in the workout room (but otherwise a really well-equipped room with high-grade headphones and lemon-infused ice water...no one seemed to care that the workout room was 85 degrees either); a Ritz-Carlton going up next door that blocks views (Howdy Neighbor!); housekeeping kept insisting on cleaning my room two hours after I checked in (never knew I was that much of a slob).",negative,en,0
"We had an awesome rate because MGM was a Yelp Spring Break partner. From the moment we pulled up to the moment we pulled away, we were treated like VIPs the entire time. First off, updated rooms.

For whatever reason, the MGM rooms were quieter than those I've stayed in at the Bellagio. \n\nSecondly, we were treated to complimentary Veuve Clicquot champagne and sweets. Yes, please! Thirdly, every time we contacted the concierge, bell or front desks, we were treated with respect and the utmost hospitality. Any questions or problems we had were addressed immediately. We were even able to procure some photos for the Yelp Goose Chase Scavenger Hunt just by asking. We had a few days to relax and even venture to the pool which was excellent. I was sad that I didn't get to go to Wet Republic though. I did hear from someone that the admission is waived for hotel guests but I don't know if that's true or not since it's normally $25.

"The Indigo had a very cool vibe, everything was bright & beachy. We stayed in a regular 2 bed room & it was a weird layout with the beds facing each other, but I can appreciate odd things like that after staying in a million hotels that all look the same.
The room had a fridge & a microwave which came in handy. Also loved the Aveda products they have.
The front desk ladies were very nice and helpful with recommendations. One of them even printed out a bunch of restaraunt menus & coupons for us!
The hotel taxi will take you anywhere within 3 miles for free which worked out great for us. We found out taxis in the Dallas area cost double what they do in New Orleans.. kinda crazy. Maybe because Dallas is a lot more spread out.
We did not use the valet as there was a parking lot a block down that cost $4 for 12 hours. We could see the car from our room, it is a safe lot.
Only downside was with the 106 degree heat & the wind that we felt was more like a hot blow dryer... we wanted to jump in a pool asap... which the hotel didn't have.
Overall, I would stay here again- no extra charges, staff was nice & helpful, within walking distance to food, bars & art museums- Sounds good to me!",positive,en,2

The staff at check in were not very friendly and the same goes for the concierge too. The Elephant and Castle bar was nice, we went for breakfast, lunch and a few drinks most days. The location is the best thing about the hotel, great views of the bay (not that we saw them from our room).

"DISGUSTING!! We booked this hotel on hotels.com and were MORTIFIED when we walked up to the front doors to see that there, behind a huge pile of tattered and disgusting ripped out carpet and nails, lay the Edwardian hotel. The stairs leading up to the first floor was de-carpeted and filled with vagabond nails and carpet spikes, the construction workers were in and out of the building when we were there, we even had to hold the door open for some of them. the whole place REEKED! We figured that it wouldn't be half bad given the price was nearing 200 dollars usd, The whole place was under renovations and it reeked of paint thinner and mold. The counter kid didn't give two craps about his job and called his manager when we refused to stay in the teeny room with the brick wall view that we unfortunately booked. The kid was told to offer us an 'upgrade' to the fourth floor. You got there via deathtrap elevator and once on the fourth floor the reek of paint thinner and mold was near unbearable. Being six months pregnant, I fear that if we stayed there any longer I would have gone through a spontaneous miscarriage. We paid and never stayed. Their policy is a cancellation fee of a full one nights stay, EVEN if it's unsafe for us to stay. The kid at the front claimed ignorance on the whole thing, and hotels.com is trying to refund at least some of the money we spent on this crap heap, which is against their policy, but because of this instance they are making an exception.

The hotel is clean and well-maintained unfortunately there is a significant amount of construction going on right now around the hotel on the street but it really did not interfere with our ability to get around. All of the staff is friendly and accommodating. The rooms are large and newly renovated but are not full of amenities such as in room coffee makers. Parking is free which is a huge plus and if you park on the third floor of the parking garage you have easy access to the elevator to take you to your room. There are plenty of places to eat and get drinks throughout the hotel and casino including a McDonald's a Mexican restaurants and sandwich shop. Within a few steps across the street you are on old Fremont Street which is filled with shops and bars restaurants clubs anything you would want to do. If you want to go to the strip it's not very far roughly expect a $20-$30 taxi ride. UBER just started in Las Vegas and is far less expensive. We were very pleasantly surprised by staying downtown this trip instead of at the fancy humongous hotels on the strip it was a nice break where we still had a lot of fun and it wasn't so chaotic.,neutral,en,1

"Great Chair w/ 2 Very Small Flaws
First off packaging, the first thing we see. Standard box, everything inside is neatly packed and the clean up is amazingly easy, aside from the big ole box that is left, but what else would we expect right? :) Assembly, I followed the instructions and they were pretty straightforward. Bolts come with Loctite(blue agent on the threads that helps the bolt resist being backed out naturally) so the bolts do not need to be super tighted, only hand tightened plus your tightening them through a pretty tough plastic, I was able to hand tighten everything without anything cracking, so the quality of materials used seems decent. Really no issue with assembly if you follow instructions. As for use, I feel this is wear it is slightly lacking. On the positive side the cushions are extremely comfortable, from the arm rests to back, to base. Everything is pretty comfortable and don't feel stiff or rough. I love leaning back in my old computer chair and kicking my feet up on anything I can get a grip on and this chair is definitely great for leaning back and relaxing. What it is lacking in is more so sizing. For instance my personal preference is I wish the arms were extended a little bit further out as it feels like I need to tuck my arms against my side to get any use out of them, not a complete deal breaker though as the arms are comfortable, just not as long as I want. Also the back piece could be a bit taller as it goes to my shoulders, unless I recline, then I can rest my head on the top of the back rest, also not an deal breaker as I am an avid gamer and play most games in a forward focused pose. But those are my two critiques of the chair.",positive,en,2

Expected from past 2 visits. \n\nWrong meal brought for me based on my asking for the cordon bleu calzone ( sounds ridiculous in hindsight I admit) yet I appeared to be pointing to the chicken milanese. \n\nYes I have an accent but that's a pretty big range of wrong to get to Milanese from calzone . The former, of which I had a bite prior to realizing that there was some dough missing was all shape, texture and no taste like they'd learned cooking from slides.

I didn't try the pizza, though it looked delicious, but since it's hard to mess up anything with burrata and I wanted something fresh- I went with the caprese. \n\nThe pesto was great, the burrata was of course really good as well and I liked the sour ciabatta it was served with. My only gripe was that it was hard to eat. I prefer fresh tomatoes, sliced. I found it a little difficult to get the delicious fresh taste of the ingredients in every bite with the roasted cherry tomatoes. I also just like the fresh flavor or raw tomato with the richness of the burrata and olive oil, and I guess the balsamic could be toned down.\n\nHowever, with all my gripes (everyone's a critic, right?), it was still very tasty, and the wine was decent and reasonably priced.

"For me, this course was disappointing. Here is why: First, the level, at which the course material is presented, is very low. It might be freshman level, but certainly not more. There are many buzzwords but no real explanations. The programming assignments are only doable because most of the work has been done by the people designing the assignments. There is very little left for the students. Furthermore, the procedures, that are already given, are not very well documented. Hence, a lot of guess work is required to figure out how things should work. Furthermore, little effort has been spent to structure the procedures that are already given. Altogether, this makes doing the programming assignments very unsatisfying.Finally, the professor presenting the materials does not take part in the discussion forums. Contrary to other courses that I have attended at Coursera, this time the discussion forum was no help at all.",negative,en,0

"Good service, good food but not as good as I was expecting, especially with the Michelin Star denotion. \n\nAfter a day of wandering on the Strip and some gambling, we were able to get seated for dinner here with no reservation (a plus). I decided to go with the lounge menu prix fixe, three courses for a very reasonable $28. There were only two options for appetizer and two for entree; I picked the Caesar salad and the fish and chips. The one dessert option was a pudding with snickerdoodles.\n\nThe Caesar salad was delicious: crisp whole romaine leaves dressed in a traditional Caesar dressing (obvious anchovy presence which I love), and fresh parmesan on top. \n\nThe fish and chips were disappointing. The french fries were very soggy. I was a little shocked that the french fries were less crispy and tasty than the ones I had for lunch at the Augustus Cafe (the 24 hour cafe in Caesar's). Maybe I just got a bad batch? The fish was also lacking in flavor and crispness. Really disappointing. In contrast, the entree my husband ordered, the gnocchi, was fantastic. \n\nThe dessert was mediocre. The three mini snickerdoodles were probably homemade but honestly didn't really taste it. Pretty blah overall. The butterscotch pudding was okay but nothing special and frankly reminded me of Jell-O pudding. \n\nThe service was pretty good; waters stayed filled and the order taken and food arrived in a timely fashion. I definitely felt that other tables were getting a little more attention but perhaps this was because we were casually dressed and I ordered off the lounge menu. The food on the regular menu is probably significantly better and indeed this was proven by my husband's gnocchi.",negative,en,0

I had a nice room on the top floor. No street noise. Friendly staff. I was pleasantly surprised at the size of the bedroom and bathroom. Comfy bed, too.

"Not a good experience at all. I used to stay here when it was the Hilton and I was expecting Hilton quality. Now that it's under new ownership, I'm very disappointed.\n\nIt started when we were checking in. I've never seen a line that long to check in before. Took about 30 minutes. When we finally got up to the counter, the receptionist claimed they couldn't find my reservation. Although I made the reservation through a Bloomspot deal, it should have been booked. She said she found it for a future date, which would have been impossible since I was simply checking rates for that date, not reserving. It was only after 20 minutes of back and forth and showing her my confirmation e-mail from Bloomspot and my receipt that they indeed took the money for the reservation via my Paypal account that they suddenly \""found it\"", and I only owed the tax.\n\nWe stayed on the 7th floor of the North Tower. There are 4 elevators but I swear only 2 are functional. The floor is supposed to be non-smoking but there was a heavy smell of smoke coming from the hallway. We passed by a room service cart outside of a room, where dirty plates and a condom wrapper were waiting for a housekeeper to wheel it away. That was at 5pm. That same cart was outside the room at 11pm, sans condom wrapper....o....k....\n\nWe got in our room, which was okay. The sheets were clean and so was the bathroom. The toilet had issues, where if someone in the next room over was showering, you couldn't flush until they were finished. We heard when everyone washed their hands, showered, or tinkled in our neighboring rooms, the plumbing was that loud. The water pressure for the sink and shower sucked also.\n\nOur TV may have been flat screen, but the quality was poor and we constantly had issues with it.\n\nAbout an hour after we checked in, our phone rang. It was Security, stating a previous guest may have left her glasses in one of the cabinet. After checking every nook and cranny in the room, we let him know that the glasses were nowhere to be found.\n\nThe following morning, while my husband and I were sleeping in, our phone rang. It was another Security person, stating the exact same thing, and half-heartedly added \""sorry if I woke you\"". I informed him that one of his colleagues already called, and, again, there were no glasses in the room.\n\nHouse keeping stayed on our floor for what seemed like all day. Since we stayed in the room most of the day, we heard/saw them. The room directly across from us was being \""cleaned\"" from 4pm to 7pm. I heard a lot more chatter than cleaning.\n\nThat night, around 2am, thankfully my husband and I were still awake. Someone knocked on our door. We knew we couldn't have been loud because we were only watching TV. After my husband asked who was at the door, it was someone saying they were bringing us towels. WE DIDN'T ORDER ANY TOWELS, AND CERTAINLY NOT AT 2AM. When my husband told the guy this, he said he looked thoroughly confused, but finally walked away.\n\nCheckout time, finally. Let's get out of here. Express checkout? You bet. Let's blow this Popsicle stand. Oh, what's that? Sir, you've been waiting for the elevator for 15 mins? 3 other elevators came in the span of another 15 minutes (not even exaggerating), which were all full. We got fed up and walked to the Central tower elevators, which came immediately and only had 2 people on it. Unbelievable.\n\nI wish I would have read the Foursquare tips saying how much of a dump this place was (seriously, dump was in every single tip except 1) before I was already standing in that long line. Sure, they gave me a free bottle of Chardonnay and $10 free slot play, but it just was too little too late. Never again.",negative,en,0

"We stayed one week in this hotel while sightseeing in New York, the location is not really that great as far as the subway is concerned, but it is a nice short walk from times square and the empire state building, rockefeller centre, etc. The restaurant in the hotel has decent food but it's way over-priced for the value, even for New York. The roof top lounge is a complete joke, it's like a casual lounge trying to be a club, and each night they totally monopolize one of the elevators to shuttle people up and down from it. The space would be much better as a casual lounge for hotel patrons, with food service and drinks (right now it's drinks only). Another note about the elevators, don't be surprised if one of them takes you for a ride up to the 20th floor even though you're supposed to be goind down, they have a mind of their own, and also get stuck frequently but don't panic it only lasts a minute. The rooms are a really nice size with extremely comfortable beds and nice amenities in the bathrooms. Front desk staff are amazingly helpful and eager to please, as are the bellmen.

"I have stayed at the Westin for the past three years, whenever I'm in need of lodging in downtown LA.. I have noticed a deterioration in room quality and service, which is sad, givn that the hotel itself is a landmark beautiful facility with lots of potential in the right management's hands.
This past stay, I had to room shop until I found a room where the AC vent and return weren't right abover my pillows. The front desk was totally unknowledgeable about which rooms were configured that way, and it wasn't until I got a manager involved on my third try that I was given a king suite, which was an oversized room with sitting area and wet bar in the green tower.
I think that only the green tower [there are also blue, red and yellow] has new furnishings and is maintained well. The hotel has become a convention hotel to the extent that it does not treat individual guests with much courtesy or attention.
The upside of the Westin is its newly renovated Reebok fitness center with disposable headsets, a great selection of breakfast places on the shopping levels of the hotel, a nice bar and gathering place in the center of the lobby, and a great downtown location.
Old furnishings, small bathrooms, and $25 valet parking are the negatives.

"The book, originally written just after the sinking of the Titanic, reflects the attitudes of the period in which it was published, especially with regard to the distinct roles of men and women. Obviously bereft of the insights derived from the discovery of the Titanic, it nevertheless raises two provocative issues: a fire in the coal bunker and unruly passengers being shot. However, I wish to clarify the matter of pictures which the mixing of reviews for two different editions has created. The text of the free public domain version is well-formatted but lacks photographs. The $.99 edition from MacMay is equally well-formatted, but it DOES have photographs. The decision, therefore, is whether the inclusion of the photos is worth spending a dollar rather than getting the text for free.

"Isn't this the worst name ever for a furniture store? When people ask me where I got my great sectional and I say the Furniture Warehouse on Bell, they say - which one? Anyhow, this little gem is located right next to J & K Furniture to the west in what kinda looks like an old barn now. It's basically an over sized \""Tuff Shed\"" and when it's hot outside - it's still hot in here. I've been here when an awful storm kicked up and it was an AWESOME place to just listen to the rain fall. But anyhow - back to the furniture.\n\nWe got a sofa here that was selling at Mor Furniture for less for approximately double. At Mor there was just one fabric choice, here I got fabric and pillow options. They also had \""cousins\"" of that sofa - both the fancy duck down pillowed one and the super basic foam filled one. So I could have gotten an upgrade, played with fabric options and still payed almost $1K less. Oh yea....\n\nThey also have some great kids beds/furniture, some really cute dining room furniture and of course other cool sofas. The service was really outstanding. When I remembered seeing an Ottoman that was no longer there, they pulled out 6-7 different catalogs of stuff to try to find them, pulling in an owner and manager to make sure they did everything they could to make sure I found just the right cheap ottoman. They even called a few of the manufacturers to make sure the leg styles were going to match. Very good service. And awesome prices.

I've been twice and it's already aging: the room control screen in our last room wasn't working, the mattress was getting saggy, and the plumbing was making noise. Also, its just not that nice after you really experience it for a few days. There's no where to eat outside (on those rare pleasant Las Vegas mornings that you really should try to take advantage of). The pool has limited hours, and you're not allowed to bring outside food or drink out there anyway. It's downright tacky the lengths that the hotel will go to to prevent you from bringing in outside food (including the staffer interrogating the family with a newborn about whether they were trying to sneak in baby food). They have no recycling or water conservation policy that we could find. And, worst of all, the internet really didn't work. For a pricier hotel, we had much higher expectations.",negative,en,0
"This show was very much a let down for me. I could see the story they were going for, however, it failed to all come together for me. I felt there was a lot of things happening that wasn't really part of what was going on. \n\nWhen the show starts out, there's no real explanation as to why this is happening. As the story progresses, you understand the point but, it doesn't make sense. \n\nAs far as the costumes, they were good and fitting for the show. I also was hoping for more tricks or acrobatics. I was a fan of Mystere, and expected some of those type talents. \n\nI will say, the stage is amazing. Watching it transform into many things for the show was so intriguing. And there was also a part with the girl in the forest type setting with a guy and that dancing was pretty cool. \n\nAll in all, I wouldn't recommend this show. Pass and watch something more entertaining.",negative,en,0
"There is no closer hotel to Quincy Market or Faneuil Hall downtown Boston...Also very close ( half of block ) to Union Oyster House restaurant and walking distance to most historic places downtown Boston....Hotel itself is fully renovated inside which looks better than outside facade. Rooms are spacious and bed very comfortable...Our balcony overlooked some bus stop and fruit market with some construction so you may ask for front view ( over to Quincy ). We only had a breakfast in hotel restaurant ...food was good , so was the service. The hotel had some issues with smoke detectors, and while we ate breakfast we had to endure fire alarm...hopefully the management came over speaker system to calm down ( my wife ) and we enjoyed Bostom firemen posing outside restaurant window. We would recommend this hotel for tourists",positive,en,2

"This might be my favorite joint in Vegas. Been coming here for years now and I've tried much of the menu. They have the best pan roast I've ever had. I love the sweetness of the pan roast. The gumbo is also awesome! Its kind of a more bitter flavor but I love the okra and the sausage in the roux. The boulliabase is also really good, more tomato flavor than the pan roast but not rich and creamy like the pan roast. One of my favorites is the clam chowder. Go here and you will not be disappointed. Warning though, there is almost always a wait.",positive,en,2

"Just completed the 2nd night of our 4 night stay here at this Kimpton hotel in Scottsdale, so it's a good time to write up a review of our experience here so far:\n\nHotel Lobby, common areas, etc: this is a motel-type resort which I think dates back to the 1950's. They have done a good job in maintaining a Southwest theme and making it look and feel up to date. You do notice a few spots though where another coat of paint is needed or something needs to be replaced/updated.\n\nRooms: Quite surprising, but our unit ( 2 double beds on the upper floor ) is actually bigger than the photos on their website show! How often does that happen? Beds are super comfortable, AC is flawless (needs to be in AZ in the summer), Wi-Fi is fast, and the flat screen is HD. As far as room noise goes, you can hear the neighbouring rooms, but we have had quiet people beside us so far. Our private balcony is a little underwhelming however, in need of a little TLC with just a parking lot view and some road noise. One thing that should be standard is a coffee maker. You can get them though if you call housekeeping and request one.\n\nPool Area: Just great. Lots of loungers, a mix of areas in the sun and shade, and a separate smaller pool with sandy beach designed for kids. Pool bar serves beer and cocktails, and there's a lunch menu too. It's a nice atmosphere, music not too loud, and no big push to join in pool games or volleyball, that kind of thing. And it's no more than a 2 minute walk from any of the rooms or the lobby.\n\nDining: have yet to try their on-site restaurant,Taggia, but judging by the excellent lunch we had poolside yesterday, it's probably very good.\n\nStaff: No wait to check in, and the front desk staff were exceptionally nice. On our first night, we called housekeeping to send someone to troubleshoot the TV in our room (remote wasn't working) and the gentleman who arrived was extremely pleasant and professional.\n\nValue: In the off-season Arizona summer, you can book in here like we did through Tingo.com for under $100/night. That includes their complimentary wine reception every afternoon at 5:30, free Wi-Fi for their In Touch members (loyalty program, free to join), plus coffee and free newspapers every morning in the lobby. I'd say overall that the FireSky is very good value.",neutral,en,1

"I had no idea what I was getting myself into when my corporate travel department booked me into the Triton Hotel in San Francisco. I will sing their praises forever for this trip! The hotel is unique, with the most welcoming staff, fun and funky lobby (called the Living Room). Rewards program came with free internet and a $10 mini-bar card (and mini-bar prices were remarkably reasonable.) Morning coffee starts each day (and as a coffee lover, I will say that it is superb coffee), and each eveneing starts with a wine reception, again in the Living Room. The guest rooms are amazing. Cozy in size, and beautifully decorated, with one of the most comfortable beds I've had in a hotel in recent memory. Will I stay in future business trips? ABSOLUTELY!

"Ladies and gentlemen, I have found my new favorite Indian food restaurant. Groupon had a deal and we snatched it up as we've been in search of trying new places. \n\nWe arrived about an hour before they were closed and it was almost empty. They still asked if we made a reservation (we did) -- so it seems like that may be a requirement for later dining during the week. Their table settings are unusual and fit perfectly with the ambiance. The tin water glasses keep your water cold throughout your meal.\n\nI searched the large menu for starters that weren't deep fried and were vegetarian-friendly, but we settled on the paneer fritters. They came with curried garbanzo beans that had the perfect amount of spice. This cheese is amazing, you guys.\n\nFor my entree, I decided to go with the vegetarian thali plate. It came with a large salad (the veggies on this were great, but the iceberg lettuce was not the best choice and it had a bit too much dressing), a curried vegetable (PERFECTION), a lentil and bean side (divine), yogurt side (perfect for cooling down the spice), large portion of colorful rice, 3 pieces of naan, a dessert (the BEST rice pudding with mango swirl) and a chai. The menu clearly states that you cannot share the thali, which I thought was hilarious because it's SO HUGE. No, seriously, I had leftovers for 2 more meals after this.\n\nMy boyfriend ordered a taro dish which they mentioned to us was 'dry' - no sauce. It tasted a lot like a potato and it wasn't my favorite -- I LOVE the sauces and spices the most - but he enjoyed it. \n\nOur bill was $47 for an appetizer, a large vegetarian thali dinner plate ($14), the taro dish and 2 of their Indian beers ($5 each). I'm a fan! Only one star off because unless you order the large vegetarian plate, all the other options are a bit pricey. I can't imagine that this place does a lunch buffet but I may be wrong.",neutral,en,1
"The weekend of September 10th, 2011 I decided to stay in Washington DC for one Saturday night while visiting family. I am a frequent business travel so am fond of Westin Hotels. The hotel operator gave me some of the pertinent details on the phone as to location as the concierge NEVER picked up his phone. Unfortunately, all of the location details were wrong. This is NOT close to Dupont Circle or the Metro especially lugging suitcases this is a haul. There is absolutely NO atmosphere in the hotel lobby, the front desk gave room keys that did not work twice, the TV picture in the room was fuzzy on most of the channels and you can hear all of the noise in the room next door. Our neighbors came in at 2:00am and banged around in their room. As the hotel was not near capacity, I had asked not to stay in an adjoining room for this reason. The housekeeping people were efficient, prompt.
For $170 for one night, you can do better for a weekend night in this area.",negative,en,0

"I always opt for B/W motels when price/location are favorable. Chose to stay here for two nights as a tourist visiting Graceland.
The Good: Nice large standard room with 'fridge; clean and inviting; good comp breakfast in the morning; friendly staff; good security; quiet neighborhood; easy Interstate I-240 on/off access; an easy short drive to Graceland.
The Not-So Good: It's in the middle of no-where. Behind the property is a heavy equip. storage depot and across the street a heavy-duty truck dealership (see photos). There is nothing within walking distance for eating or shopping. The drive to Graceland is through a neighborhood of pawn shops, gas station mini-marts and boarded-up buildings.
The tour of Graceland is a surprisingly delightful experience. Unfortunately its location is awful. Elvis Presley Blvd has nothing but fast-food drive-thru's; no sit-down-and-be-served restaurants such as an Applebee's, Chili's, Denny's or Outback.
If you are visiting Graceland (a MUST SEE) with family I would suggest staying either in downtown Memphis or outside of town.",negative,en,0
"These chain of restaurants have the best service that you can get in Vegas, it is genuine and warm. I've worked for the industry in Vegas for almost 3 years and it is so refreshing to find servers and service of these quality.

I am latina and firefly is THE only place in vegas that offers a tasteful place to enjoy latin american culture. I hate to hear people bad-mouthing these great restaurants, but plz keep in my these are ignorant people. Before any out there start pointing fingers, check your own kitchen and how you prepare you on own food, there are more chances that you will get food poison in your own kitchen, than in Firefly. Media is just taking advantange that Firefly is a place loved by locals and they are just making money out bad publicity.

"I really enjoyed this movie. Yes there was disrespect throughout the movie, but Bruce Willis learned, from The Kid, that there is more value in repecting others, and his life of disrespect needs to change. This movie was a refreshing change from the trash that Hollywood is trying to shove down our throats. There are some very good lessons to be learned in this movie. I really believe this was one of Disneys best, even though a couple of things could have been left out. I was impressed with the lack of swearing and lack of sexual inuendos. It isn't perfect, but much better than most everything else out there.",positive,en,2
"I stayed in one of the rooms at Copley House at the end of June. We were looking for a small suite style accommodation. If it could be historic, all the better. When we checked in we were told that the unit that had been reserved was not available. We specifically needed two beds and they told us that there were none available. After we protested they went ahead and gave us a room that was reserved for a different party. I can only assume that is what happened to our room. The desk attendant was clearly overwhelmed and was having a hard time dealing with checking us in at the same time that another party was arriving. He kept mumbling to himself about how ""nobody else was doing their job right"" and ""how was he expected to deal with this"" and ""what am I to do"". Very unprofessional in front of guests. Oh, and while we were waiting another guest walked into the office. We struck up a conversation with them to find out that they spent the majority of their first evening without a/c.
We eventually got our room keys and walked the short distance to our assigned room. We were on the third floor. The first staircase was ok, the second began to look and feel as if it were structurally unsound. By the time we reached the third staircase there were obvious gaps where the railing was pulling away from the stairs and the stairs themselves were slanting downward to the right at such a severe angle that one really had to question if they were safe. It really would have been interesting to navigate those stairs with a few drinks in you. The room was picked up, but not what I would call clean. One of the cabinet doors in the mini kitchen was coming off its hinges and the whole place was just kind of shabby.
All that said, the neighborhood was great. Very close to the Green and Orange subway lines making getting around the city on public transportation very easy. many good restaurants in the neighborhood and a convenient grocery two blocks away where we purchased breakfast food to prepare in our mini-kitchen. Nice park across the street and a laundromat one block the other direction. This could have been a perfect place to stay but we were just so disappointed in the condition of the room, about the quality of a pretty bad college apartment.
Judging by the mix of reviews maybe they have some apartments that are in better shape and some, like ours, that are not.",positive,en,2

"Khoury's has amazing food. Whenever I'm craving hummus I know exactly where to go! The servers here though... I don't know what to make of them. The service and the food just don't match up. Sadly, it's not just one of the servers, but all that I've been in contact with except the woman with the accent. She is sweet but you can tell she just doesn't care. I came in one night to pick up a food order and stood at the host desk for no joke, 10minutes. I tried to get the attention of the two girls working and it seemed like they were ignoring me. So they are either that oblivious to what's in front of them or they are just not all the way there. However, the food is so good I always looked past the service until today. I called in a lunch order and I asked the woman on the phone if they had a hummus wrap with veggies and chicken. She said they did but it wasn't on the menu so I went ahead and ordered it. Well come to find out it was a piece of bread, hummus, and cilantro. It was literally an entire order of hummus thrown in a piece of bread. Not cool. I even told her what I wanted. I felt extremely ripped off and it made me not want to return. It makes me sad because I literally love the food, but the waitstaff really needs to be replaced with people who actually care and value customers like the owner does.",negative,en,0

"Overall, this hotel wasn't that bad for me but I can definitely believe the reviews that think it was. I was extremely unhappy to arrive at 1:30 p.m. and find that I had no parking as the lot was full. They advertise as having parking. To me, that means that you have a spot for EVERY room in your hotel. I was instructed to park in a garage a block away. This was very scary as Hollywood Boulevard was a very seedy area with many scary people lurking about. What made it worse was that we had to leave at 4 a.m. to drive back to San Diego to fly home which meant that I had to walk in the pitch black to go get the car. I was scared to death as I walked by people sitting outside at that time at the seedy hotel next door and homeless people on the street. I feel very lucky to be alive and with all of my money. As far as the room, it wasn't the cleanest but passable. the most basic room I have ever seen, though. Not one thing hung on the walls and like others have said, NO CLOCK. This made me very uncomfortable to rely on a wake up call for our 4 a.m. wake up. We set our cell phones but had never done that before so I was scared to rely on that also. We should have been alarmed that the check in desk is behind what looks like bullet proof glass. I so wish we had stayed in a nicer area and just driven to Hollywood Boulevard to see the sites since I had to pay for a parking garage anyways.",negative,en,0

"We stayed for 2 nights while in Boston for the weekend. The rooms are nicely furnished and the views over the harbor are amazing - if you bend over the couch you can see pretty sail boats go by. Wow! There's lots of space, not much of a kitchen but there's so many places to eat nearby. We highly recommend the falafel in Quincy market, the flavor of which you can savor for hours afterwards. You can also spend $80 on 5 minutes worth of oysters, worth every penny. The food at the Custom House is to die for, they have hard boiled eggs and waffles, which is a good because it's impossible to find a breakfast place nearby. The concierge said the nearest good breakfast restaurant was in New York City. I found that hard to believe, I think maybe she was new to concierging.
The best part of our stay was the late night entertainment. From the room you can see real drunkards in the streets below, fist fights, people falling over, girls yelling at each other, and actual arrests made by real live policement in big vans. Since I live in the country, this was better than TV, and I was kept up until 3 am by the sirens and the intense action. There is no extra charge for the entertainment. The 6am foghorn is an added bonus if you're an early riser. If it's not foggy you might need to book a wake up call.
The view from the top of the building is fantastic, well worth the long elevator journey. But then elevators are a passion of mine so having to take 2 different ones to get to the top gave twice the opportunity for fun. Oh yeah!

"I thought this movie was cleverly written and very well acted. Its a movie that greatly surpasses other films in terms of originality and enjoyment.Rupert Grint played the part marvelously, and has a general knack for the acting business. The almost obsessive mother added quite a lot to the plot, and was a character one could almost instantly loathe. This reminded me, in a way, of the Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood. Not by means of actual content of the film, but the premises, and overall tone to the film itself. ""Driving Lessons"" is a coming of age story, which many might find very easy to relate to due to the overpowering mother, the lack of freedom, and the discovery of oneself.",positive,en,2

"The Casablanca is a real gem, from the moment that you arrive to when you leave, you know that your enjoyment of your stay and of your time in NYC is important to the hotel staff. Our room, like the rest of the hotel, was fitted out to a high standard and whilst it lacked a view, it was quiet and clean.
The breakfast buffet is well done prvoviding a great place to plan the day ahead and exchange ideas with the other guests. The 24 hr service in the cafe is a real bonus, especially when coping with the need for an early morning coffee to offset the effects of jet-lag.
The location of the hotel is perfect, especially if you feel the need to drop by to freshen up after a days sightseeing before heading out for supper.",positive,en,2

"One of my absolute favorites in CU, Courier Cafe is the best place to relax and get some delicious American food. Old fashioned soda fountain favorites like phosphates and malt shakes make this place unique, but nearly everything is good. Sandwiches are on fresh bread, and burgers are thick and hearty. There are a lot of vegetarian options- my favorite is the pesto grilled swiss on sourdough. I also love the ham melt on a fresh croissant. For dessert I recommend sharing a headliner, a monstrously delicious sundae drenched in hot fudge.\n\nFor the quality of food you get, this place is actually a bargain. I'd prefer it over most of CU's \""fine dining\"" establishments any day. Service can be slightly slow, but overall this is one of my favorite places to enjoy after a difficult test or a arduous paper-writing spree.",positive,en,2

"Kind of a small club. There were some outdoor areas but it was too cold to venture out. I was here on a Saturday night, at around 12pm the line was fairly short. Our friends were already there earlier and so we were on the guestlist. We walked right in - past some people who had to pay, hehe. \n\nFree clubbing is always fun. $20 drinks are not as. After a bit we went out to one of the bars at the casino to drink, and was able to re-enter into Surrender. \n\nDecor-wise, the club is not much compared to XS or Lavo or any of the bigger clubs. The crowd was decent - a lot of youngish people in their 20s. Most of the creepy old guys lurked around the pole dancers. The music was mostly top 40's, with a mix of other genres. \n\nQuite enjoyable place for my first Las Vegas clubbing experience. Go here if you don't have to pay to get in.",negative,en,0

"Just to clear up the confusion caused by the conflicting (and some rather dubiously effusive) reviews on this website: this hotel has NO room service, NO free internet, and it's NOT a Starwood property any longer. There is no bar and no restaurant in the evening.
The hotel full of holiday groups for whom it's probably fine, but I was here alone on a business trip and the $373 a night I was charge is simply a rip-off.
The hotel is generally tatty, with remnants of its former glory visible but it's in dire need of a make-over. The attempt to tart up the lobby only serves to emphasise the poor state of the place elsewhere. The breakfast buffet is pretty good and not too bad for New York at $22 + tip.

"We stayed at the Olive 8 for two nights this weekend, and it was a nice hotel. New and clean and making a lot of being environmentally friendly. There were some negatives, though. 10$ a day for internet access seems a ripoff. We were told the valet parking was 29$ a day, and so decided to go for it, but when I just checked our bill it was 42$. Additionally, our room wasn't ready when we arrived at 430 and although we were happy to sit in the bar for a couple of hours until it was, it was hard to imagine what accounted for the delay (especially since we were not offered any explanation and it seems to be a common story).
Overall, I would say that it lacked atmosphere compared to other places we have stayed, and the extra costs don't seem justified.",negative,en,0

We think the hotel is okey, nothing more than that. Oure room was very cheap and ok fore the money.

The cleaning boy cleaned the bathroom and the bed but not the rest of the room.
The breakfast was very good....we loved it!! Nothing to complain about. The situation is good if you have a car. We was trying to find a nice restaurant near the hotel by food. We only find a scary little restaurant. The food was good but a scary place.
We paied 90 US a night. That´s cheap!! If you rent a car...this place is very valuable with nice breakfast!!!",negative,en,0
"Don't pay any attention to the previous negative comments. They are unfounded or perhaps it was a different Hotel Adagio. My wife and I stayed here in February of 2004 for my 40th birthday and enjoyed every minute of our stay at the Hotel Adagio. To put this into proper perspective I travel frequently for work and stay at some of the best hotels in the country such as the Soho Grand and Le Parker Meridian in NYC as well as the Mondrian and Shutters in L.A. We chose the Adagio after considering several others such as the Clift (which is across the the street), the Rex and the Monaco. We could not have been happier with our choice. The Hotel Adagio ranks up there with all of them in terms of accomodations and helpfulness of staff. Upon arrival we were asked if we would like to upgrade to a suite for a mere $25 extra per night. What a bargain. The hotel compares to any of the Phillip Stark designed hotels, however, without all the attitude. After a long day of sightseeing and shopping we looked forward to returning to the Adagio for a couple glasses of wine at the stylish (albeit beautiful people scene) bar and then relaxing in our room. If I were returning to San Francisco tomorrow I would stay at the Hotel Adagio in a heartbeat. Do yourself a favor and stay at this wonderful hotel.",positive,en,2

"Beaumont to Billings via Dallas. The tickets were ridiculously expensive. The same day I booked, I had to change our flights to the next day. Even though the tickets were still same price for the next day as the ones I purchased, I was charged 150 dollars for the change. Then American Airlines pressured me into buying trip insurance, telling me that it would cover any airline changes and cancellations. As I boarded the plane going home, AA cancelled the connecting flight. When I landed in Dallas, I received text that AA re-booked connecting flight for the next day. Now they don't want to pay for the cancelled and re-booked flight (that I was unable to take & I had to rent a car to drive 6 hours home which cost me over 300 dollars). When they were pressuring me to buy the insurance, they NEVER told me the insurance only kicks in after a 12 hr delay. This delay was overnight. Meaning I originally had an evening connecting flight that was cancelled. So, my children & I were supposed to spend the night in DFW airport Isn't that why I bought trip insurance To cover the costs when this happens I know they cannot control the weather, but they could honor the insurance they pressure their customers to buy and not make ridiculous parameters that hinder customers from receiving relief from the insurance. Furthermore, ridiculous fees AA charges for changing flights (after booking the same day within a few hours) is even more reason why I love Southwest. American Airlines need to take lessons from SWA. I was very disappointed that Southwest Airlines do not fly to Billings, MT or I would have definitely flown SWA - No hidden fees, no baggage fees, no fees for changing flights, and amazing customer service!",negative,en,0

They sent me blurred and out of focus photos to try and back their claim. The one photo that was in focus showed a few scratches on the edge of the device around the charging connector on an 18 month old phone, no more than approximately 2mm in length.

"Went to the POOL party here and it was a great break from the heat. Glad I got in free, I guess they sometimes charge $10 to get in for guys?! I would not drive here to a pool party and pay $10. Maybe its me, but was not impressed with the pool or spot in general. \n\nI did buy a bucket of Bud light lime, 4 beer's. Also lack of shade, I got there at about 1130 and the only seats are in direct sun. I ended up meeting someone there and they told me you have to get there at 830 to get an umbrella covered chair. I did see some guest bringing umbrellas from home to accommodate the lack of shade. Luckily I got shade or I would of left within an hour. \n\nPool is on the large side, mostly 4 feet deep, so really a soak er pool for everyone to hang out in. It was nice with a group of people I came with, luckily I did not get hit with the footballs, tennis balls, Frisbees, etc., being thrown around in the pool. I did see various people get hit in the face, top of the head with various objects, so be prepared.\n\nAlso a few brawls or \""boys being boys\"" showing how tough they are moments and security had to escort some people out.....\n\nIf your a guy and nothing better to do and feel alright spending $10 just to sit by the pool and can drop $20 on 4 beers be my guest....I rather just invite my friends over to my house and swim in my pool. At least there I wont have to worry about getting hit by a football, tennis ball, or Frisbee by some drunk guy. Not trying to be harsh, but I think that is a mood killer when I see random girls and guys get hit in the face and everyone then asking if they are ok? They don't want to be the one to spoil the fun of others and say its ok??? Not cool....\n\nAs for the casino, Vegas style full of smoke inside, can smell cigarettes soon as you open the door. Love the self park and the hike to the casino. Yes they do have golf carts to get you to your car, but only one was going back and forth so is it better to stand in 110 degree weather waiting 10 minutes for them to come get you or just suck it up and walk to the door. I went hiking for the door to get into ac as soon as possible.\n\nMy review does not include rooms or casino stay since I live 45 minutes away, I would not stay here and also I am not a gambler so I stayed clear of the casino floor. \n\nOverall I wish the pool party had more shade for guest, drinks were less, and security had more control over the tennis ball, football, and Frisbee throwing. When the pool is full the chances of hitting someone is very high....Not my idea of a fun time to get a tennis ball in my face from across the pool......",negative,en,0

"Could not have enjoyed it more. The room was beautiful, with the aforementioned huge windows and marble bath. Everything was inviting and comfortable, with the sunny room done in cream and serene green (I was expecting hip and stark, as at other boutique hotels). Great black-out curtains. The lobby is phenomenal, as is the bar and most enjoyably, the terrace where we ate breakfast alone. So quiet and peaceful. And the view from the terrace: I never knew that the Bowery hid an 1800s stone-walled cemetary and a grass and tree-filled expanse.
The staff was also warm and pleasant.
I am sure once the restaurant and nightclub open guests will no longer feel that they have the place to themselves--glad we got to experience it. I am also curious to see what the rates jump to. We paid $350/night for a queen room.
We have stayed at the Gansevoort (thumping club music, overrun neighborhood and cold decor) as well as the new version of the Gramercy Park Hotel, which was dark, bordello chic and maybe a warmer version of Ian Shrager but still a bit off-putting. The Bowery hotel has the best atmosphere, hands-down.",positive,en,2

This obviously prevented any possibility of what the hotel likes to call ""wellness."" These dogs also woke us at 6:30 AM on the Sunday morning of my last stay.

"Imagine your a hungry lion, locked in a shopping mall full of people. They are athletic, unarmed, and some of them have been good enough to coat themselves in A1 or barbecue sauce. Welcome to the Fogo de Chao experience.\n\nMeat orgy! It's absolutely magnificent, take over half a dozen different piping hot well prepared varieties of meat including top sirloin, bottom sirloin, Filet Mignon, pork loin, beef ribs, pork ribs, and lamb stuffed onto skewers that could double as props for a film about Roman gladiators. Hand said savory redolent skewers to an assorted band of servers that seem to dance in and out of crowded tables full of people with amazing ease all at the beck and call of a little piece of paper. It's fantastic! They have wonderful sides as well including caramelized bananas, polenta, and garlic mashed potatoes. There is also a salad bar, and I think it was nice but quite honestly wasn't the analogy about the damn lion the point here?\n\nHappy hunting.",neutral,en,1
"I really like coming to the Petersen Events Center because I've had some great memories here from graduations to concerts and performances, this center really can entertain on a multitude of levels! The Petersen was very spacious for both my college graduation and my sister's high school graduation. Although there were many people there, the place is spacious enough that you do not feel overwhelmed with people. Even when I went for the Demi Lovato concert and the Cirque Du Soleil, the space was a perfect size and did not feel overly packed or crowded. The Pitt basketball game I went to was much busier than the other events because I sat located in the \""Pitt zoo\"" area, although I was in and out with no problem. The prices are reasonable for souvenirs for performances and concerts, and although the stands can get busy, you can purchase your items in relatively no time. The bathrooms are spacious and I've never had to wait to use the restroom due to long lines and few stalls. There is pretty large outside area, where you can take pictures, wait for a ride, or just enjoy the beautiful Pittsburgh campus! I enjoy every visit to the Pete and look forward to the next time I get to enjoy this venue and all it has to offer.",neutral,en,1

"My wife and I stayed at this hotel for a few days earlier this month. Sadly we were left feeling quite let down by the whole experience.
We arrived to find that our room reeked of cigarette smoke. We'd asked for and been shown to a non smoking floor but obviously the previous tenant had smoked heavily during their stay. Surely housekeeping should have warned management that the room needed treating before they allowed anybody else into it. The hotel did find us another room, but it took them an hour, just what we wanted at 10pm after a long flight from LA.
On leaving it took the hotel a full hour, and three reminders, to bring our bags down. We were left sitting on a bench seat near the front door. It was only when I asked for my key back so I could get my bags myself that something was done. It looked like a VIP was checking out as they seemed busy bringing 20 or more bags down from another room.
In between, we got the usual top class, five star yet largely impersonal treatment that one would expect from a chain of this type but is this really good enough when paying $1300 per night?",negative,en,0

"Came on a Sunday morning at 7AM. I think we were the 3rd group there and the place was practically empty. But even so, the waiters were prompt and attentive. We didn't feel like they were hoovering over us making sure our coffee cups were full. We got an outside table. It was a clear, blue sky morning and warm. Not many people walking the strip (probably sleeping in from the night before). A couple runners here and there. \n\nOrdered:\n- coffees\n- croissant sandwich\n- big skinny pancakes (I think it was a special of the day)\n- homemade brioche\n\nCoffee was great. Smoother than Starbucks Blonde (as a comparison). Croissant sandwich was good. Nothing really special about it. Skinny pancakes were great. Never had them before. With the whip cream and fruit, it was a light n sweet treat to compliment my black coffee. Never had brioche, so I didn't know what to expect. But at first sight, it looked like a french toast without the syrup or egg brush. Just a thick toast basically with a side of butter. In comparison, to everything we ordered, the brioche was the most bland (maybe that's what it's suppose to be). Overall, I think the price of the food could be a bit cheaper. Maybe knock of $2/item on the breakfast menu while keeping the same quality/portions would be fair. If that were the case, I would compensate by tipping the waiter more. \n\nDetailed Ratings:\nService: 5\nAmbiance/View: 5\nFood: 4",neutral,en,1

Excuse me, what? Yes - you read that right, the dog cost more a night than the room itself. \n\nThe Hotel: The hotel is supposedly being renovated... The room was dingy, along with the hallways, and stairwell reeked of urine. The hallway that lead to our room had wallpaper falling the trip or \""crown molding\"" missing. Our room itself was kind of dingy but was fairly clean - minus the fact that it was overlooking in to a space in the parking garage. \n\nThe Casino: My fiance and I aren't really big gamblers but we do occasionally put a $20 into the penny slots, just to mess around. The casino was clean and bustling with patrons and cocktail waitresses. No real complaints (all casinos stink of smoke). \n\nBe sure to get there early or extremely late - the check in process takes about 15minutes and another 45 just standing in line.",negative,en,0
"On an early Saturday evening the restaurant wasn't crowded but as time went by the noise level increased a few decibels as families with children started to arrive. We had asked to be seated close to the door in view of the big screen TV showing the Olympics but the ambient noise level became barely tolerable as the kids behind us squirmed to be seated. The good news was Sam Adams on tap plus finally, a restaurant with lettuce wraps appetizers with more than enough lettuce to cover the minced chicken, Shitake mushrooms, water chestnuts and green onions in a soy ginger sauce. Most of the time more lettuce is needed and one has to wait for more. In terms of lettuce wraps, PF Changs does a better job but as I say there was more than enough lettuce.\n\nNormally, we order one of the thin and crispy Neapolitan pizzas such as the classic Margherita but this time broke ranks for the \""new\"" pizza called Pear & Gorgonzola. The ingredients (caramelized pears, Gorgonzola, Fontina and Mozzarella cheeses, caramelized sweet onions and chopped hazelnuts) sounded different and inviting. Indeed it was different from the usual fare and quite a mixture of tastes with some crunch and caramelization flavors. It was somewhat of a surprise to have it topped with field greens tossed in a house Gorgonzola ranch dressing. Thumbs up for the pizza and neutral to negative for the field greens topping. If there had been a choice of toppings another would have been ordered.\n\nNext time I would request a quieter portion of the restaurant away from the front door.",negative,en,0

"I travel around 60 days a year between business and pleasure and get to see a lot when it comes to hotel properties. I usually satisfied with any decent chain “business class” hotel property.
To put this review in perspective, I am a bit of a “hotel snob” and generally have no problem dropping $300+ a night for a NYC mid-town hotel room in a modern building with relatively clean and well appointed rooms. I am not that picky with every little detail, but I am not a fan of “old”. When I walk into a hotel room, I want to say to myself “nice room” and have no issue taking my shoes off and walking around barefoot. Give me a “Hilton” caliber of business class hotel and I will likely be happy.
This joint is just plain old, which you can get in NYC if you don’t do your homework. For this particular stay, I needed a room for a Yankees game and didn’t feel like paying an arm and a leg for a NYC room considering I was just going to be sleeping there after a long day of baseball and lots of beer consumption. And while I basically ended up sleeping in the room, next time I will spend some extra coin and stay at a “Hilton”.
For this stay I did Priceline. I was awarded this hotel and got an incredible room rate for NYC Midtown, especially for right across the street from Penn Station and MSG. The location is great. But in the end, this hotel just wasn’t my style, and it didn’t come close to meeting my needs for a modern, “clean feeling”, and well appointed room. Like I said, the joint is just plain old.
The rooms have window A/C units, the carpets looked clean, but just “felt” dirty, and the bathrooms were outdated. The best way to describe it was that I simply didn’t want to take my shoes off and walk around. Maybe it is the cleanest place in Manhattan…but it just didn’t “feel” that way. It is just old.
On a positive note, the staff was very friendly, especially at check in. But unfortunately next time, I will stick to my “Hilton”.",negative,en,0

"We were in San Francisco for a conference, and stayed on for several days. The conference was at the Fairmont, but it was oversold for the last night of our stay, so we booked the last night at the Mark Hopkins across the street. I was excited to stay in this hotel, as it also is one of the grand hotels on Nob Hill. The location is wonderful, but after 4 nights at the Fairmont, the Mark Hopkins was a disappointment.
When we checked in, our room was not ready which was not a surprise as it was noon, so we checked our luggage and went out for lunch/sightseeing. When we returned, we were shown to an upgraded luxury terrace suite on the 15th floor. It had a sitting room, bedroom, lovely bath and glassed in terrace with fantastic views. But upon further inspection, the rooms were poorly laid out. The bedroom bureau was small and narrow and had a TV on top, so there was no surface to put anything on. There was no desk, only cocktail tables and lamp tables. Both TVs were old style, not even flat screen, let alone HD like the Fairmont. When I had booked the room, I specified extra feather pillows, and when we checked in, I requested them again. I finally had to call again at 1:30 am, because they were weren't there, and because the bed was so hard and uncomfortable, I could not sleep without the extra pillows. The marble and granite bath was lovely with a separate shower and whirlpool tub which we did both use. However, the bath was equipped with water savers on the shower and sink, which caused lack of water pressure and volume and made showering unpleasant.
The hotel seems somewhat understaffed, and although the prices were identical with the Fairmont, (room price, breakfast buffet, drink prices) there was a huge difference between the two, and the Mark Hopkins paled in comparison.",positive,en,2

The story idea was good and so is the author's writing style, but for me there were too many things that didn't add up. Riley is supposed to be excellent as a profiler, but I didn't really view her insights as extraordinary. In fact, sometimes she's rather dim-witted, as evidenced by one of the later scenes in the book with the female patient. Most of the action seemed to be a frantic race from one place to another, where the minor characters ended up doing more of the rescuing or discoveries than the main characters. I didn't feel a lot of investment in the romance between Riley and Thayne either. Maybe it's because the reader doesn't get to see their attraction for each other from the beginning of their relationship.",neutral,en,1

"We booked a king suite to celebrate our first wedding anniversary and I was excited to enjoy a beautiful hotel room! The staff were polite though I think they may have been new at the job as they often couldn't answer our questions.
The room that we received had a blown light bulb, the A/C didn't cool the room under 70, and the A/C unit made a loud chirping noise that you could hear over the TV. We asked to be switched to a room without the chirping A/C and they told us (over the phone) that they were completely booked. We went down to the desk a bit later to ask if there was anything that they could do and found out that, in fact, they were not completely booked. They offered to move us to a different room (a queen suite, which was a downgrade). The second room also had defects - a stained shower curtain and bathtub fittings that could be pulled completely out of the tub.
Overall, this was not a terrible hotel experience, but since it was a new hotel, I expected things to be nicer - especially for the price! The fact that the staff was unwilling to help us without significant nagging sealed the deal: I would not stay at this hotel again.",negative,en,0

"Gold Coast to Shanghai via Hong Kong. My bag did not arrive with my business class flight with Hong Kong Airlines from Gold Coast to Shanghai via Hong Kong. I left instructions with HK Airlines for it to be forwarded to me at my hotel in Shenzen as I was departing shortly afterwards for that city. It took innumerable calls to track my luggage - I was finally informed more than 24 hours later that it had arrived at Shenzhen airport and I had to go and pick it up myself. This was after 9 pm at night. They refused to deliver to my hotel like any other airline would do. I had no alternative but to go the airport myself the following morning. The airport was an hour from the city, and i had appointments that i had to cancel to go there. Once there I had to wait 2 hours as the bag was not where they had said. It was an extremely difficult situation for me as very few people at the airport spoke english. After many phone calls to Hong Kong and Shanghai, the bag was finally located at a totally different place from where I had been told. Altogether it took almost 4 hours to get my bag back at my hotel. The bag also had a cut in the side. The only compensation HK Airlines offered for all this stress and inconvenience was the cost of the taxi to and from the airport! All in all, pretty poor service for an international airline!",negative,en,0

"This hotel is wonderful! The staff is professional yet friendly. The amenities are delightful. We had a view of the harbor and enjoyed watching 2 sailing regattas for the warmth of our room on a brisk December Saturday.
We had purchased the 5 star package - room, parking, 5 course dinner with paired wines in Meritage and full American breakfast in the morning. Late in the afteroon we recived a bottle of Veuve Clicquot and delicious sweets! What a wonderful surprise.
Dinner was not quite the 5 stars we expected - more like 3 1/2. The wines were nicely paired, the service was good but the dishes not exciting with the exception of the scallop stew.
Breakfast was a buffet when we expected sit down service. However after we had eaten most of our breakfast, we overheard the host as he seated the table next to us say that they could order eggs in addtion to the buffet. The person who seated us failed to tell us this.
Would we stay at the hotel again - in a split second! Would we consider dinner at Meritage - probably not as quickly.",positive,en,2

"Fast food meets wok cooking, Sake Express has worked out how to combine a bunch of ingredients and make it into a double dozen number of entrees. Pick your protein (chicken, steak, shrimp, scallops, etc), pick your veggies (mushrooms, snap peas, etc) and pick your starch (noodles, white rice, brown rice or none) and a few minutes later, it's brought to your table. If you're looking to filly your belly for only a handful of dollars, this is the place. The noodles and rice take up most of the space - so if you're eating low carb you might be disappointed with the quantity.\n\nHere's my complaint. They have a wait staff who brings your order to the table and they are also responsible for refilling your drinks. There is a big sign over the soda fountain (Pepsi products) area that it's \""employees only\"". Which is a problem because our waiter spent ten minutes talking to two customers at one of the outside tables instead of checking in on us. Bruce gets thirsty, donchaknow?",negative,en,0

I feel the reservation didn't do anything. When I made the reservation, I noted we were celebrating a birthday. Now I don't expect a free sundae like it's an Applebees or anything, but not a single person acknowledged the birthday. We were sent to the bar after not getting seated for our 8pm reservation. It took them 15 minutes (up until the time we were seated) to get drinks. Then, there was a confusing 5 min conversation about transferring the charges to our table. My guess is they found 4 of the most attractive women they could find that never worked a day in food service, and hired 2 as hostesses and the other 2 as bartenders. The service staff at the table was ok, but when the bill is $300 for 3 people, I expected more.

"Only in Las Vegas can a fine dining restaurant the caliber of Rosemary's exist in the same strip mall as a restaurant called the \""Krazy Buffet\"". But once you get into Rosemary's, you realize that it's the real deal. The ambiance of the room is pleasant, basically what you'd expect from a neighborhood fine dining restaurant. Even with the open kitchen, the room was moderately lit and fairly quiet, with a clientele of mainly couples in their fifties. The bar up front is small but perfect for couples waiting for other guests to join them, with a friendly bartender and probably the best selection of Belgium beers I've seen in the city.\n\nThe food we had was excellent, particularly the specials they had for the evening. My rib eye steak was delicious, though particularly fatty even for a rib eye. The other guests at our table really enjoyed their food as well, and we wanted to really like Rosemary's. Unfortunately the service was such that I doubt we'll be going back any time soon.\n\nTo be fair, it all came down to our particular server, who was surly, humorless and did everything he could to make us feel uncomfortable short of being overtly rude. The service systems they have in place are excellent (all the food is brought to the table at once, offering napkins to match clothing etc.), but when your server frowns, doesn't tell you the wine selections being brought to your table and generally does everything with a sneer, by the end of the meal what should have been a great experience becomes tainted to say the least.\n\nIt's a shame really, because a great fine dining restaurant off the strip is something we have been looking for. And Rosemary's could have been that place we would go back to again and again. But with so many choices in Las Vegas, we'll probably just keep on looking.",negative,en,0

"This was my first time staying in Hollywood. I had been on tours of the area before but never stayed over night. The area is renown for homelessness and prostitution. I was travelling with my husband, 3 children and their grandmother. I wanted somewhere central so we didn't have to spend a fortune on tours/travelling to 'where the action is'. Also travelling with small children, it's very hard to predetermine if they will be able to adventure out of the hotel on any given day. Thankfully, this was the perfect location for us! Being a group of 6, we had to book two rooms at previous stops (which was very expensive) but we were all able to stay in the one room at this hotel. It was spacious and really nice. During our trip we stayed at 4 different hotels and this was everyone's favorite. Internet access was great, breakfast was fine (USA food is not my favorite), there is a pool and gym facility (and they give you additional towels which is something little but helpful). Security into the hotel was good, staff very helpful, the hotel smelt really nice which is good because there are some not so nice smelling areas in the neighbourhood. Originally, I was a little concerned that I wouldn't feel safe with the kids being in the centre of the action. But I felt 100% comfortable and 100% happy with this hotel, the location and the service they provided. The hotel is close enough to be 'in the action' but away enough to stay out of the 'dodgy areas'. I found the hotel very family friendly but if I was traveling alone or with a partner, it would also be great. Because the hotel is so close to everything including Kodak Theatre, Walk of Fame, Wax Museum, Universal Studios etc, I was able to save money on shuttle's/ tours to these places. Because of the convenient location, I was also able to buy a bulk discounted theme park ticket and get cheaper admission to the other theme parks including Universal Studios. Often when you purchase theme park tickets they include the shuttle which is generally a couple of hundred dollars more. Because we could catch the train to Universal and buy the discounted entry, I saved around $600. I think people need to remember when staying in an area such as this, there will be homelessness, prostitution and dodgyness but that's the adventure! I highly recommend this hotel. They do a great job with what they have to work with. Very happy customer!!",positive,en,2

"Okay I started using this service about two years ago so I have some real life experience here.
The content is poooooop. I'm not allowed to swear unfortunately. It's the same stuff over and over again. Look at the channels. I'm serious, look at the TV guide and then come back to this review.
In six days Spongebob is shown 80 that's 80 times, Horrid Henry is shown 150 times in four days and oven on CN The Amazing World of Gumball is shown 253 times. I got this information from Tvguide uk website. In six days 253 times. The other channels aren't much better to be honest. Gold is pretty terrible as well.

"This may have been some of the best Italian take out I have had in the midtown/downtown Phoenix area in a long time. The husband and I picked up some delicious food here last night. We split a calzone with pepperoni and basil, a side of meatballs, and an order of garlic bread. Total? 18$...whaaaat?!?! Awesome! and it was a ton of food too. The meatballs were really good, soft, but not too soft, and flavorful. The garlic bread was nothing too special, but it was standard. The calzone was very good. They loaded this thing with basil, it wasn't like a little bit here and there, so I appreciated that. Additionally, it had a lot of pepperoni...too much for me, but the husband loved that. They top the calzone with garlic and bake until it's golden brown.... this thing was so delicious and large, we certainly had leftovers. I also found out that this place will deliver all the way out to my house at 15th ave and mcdowell....awesome! This may be my new go to pizza. \n\n\nPS this place is very accommodating, they have vegan and gluten free menus... awesome!",neutral,en,1

"convenient to catch your flight like mine departing at 7am. remember to ask for a room facing off the runway. my first room given was a one facing toward the runway that was about 500 to 600 feet away, and it was very challenging to sleep thru the night. with switching to a room facing the downtown direction, it was much nicer but still could hear the taking off and touching downs. good part is it was much quieter once it was 12 mid night.

The specials are also only at the bar area or patio area, so be sure to snag the first seat you see; it's first come first serve.\n\nMy favorites have been the Spicy Shrimp and Eggplant (you have to scoop up every bit of that sauce!), Braised Meatballs and Polenta (I had no idea what polenta was before this, but now I love it), and the Sliced Steak Bruschetta. There are many more items on the menu but these have stood out to me the most.\n\nDining outside is great, especially in front of a roaring fire on a cool fall evening.

"Whatever you do, please do not stay at this hotel - I've just returned from NYC and had the misfortune to have stayed at The Bedford. Although the location was great, that's about all that can be said for it. When we checked in some other friends in our party immediately had to call the manager to their room as they found human excrement on one of the towels in their bathroom (I know, it's gross). Our room wasn't quite so bad - just exposed wires on the walls and a bathroom in which the bath was filthy, the hairdryer wasn't fixed to the wall properly and had wires hanging out at the back, and a sink that broke during our stay. Most of the staff we dealt with were very rude and unhelpful, to the point where it really affected our holiday. It's also worth noting that although the hotel has a restaurant and bar, for two nights of our four night stay we couldn't get in there, once because it was closed for a private party and hotel residents weren't allowed in, another night it just wasn't open, so don't depend on being able to use the hotel bar. Overall we were horribly disappointed with our stay, it was in no way worth the money we paid and I'd urge anyone NOT to stay there so they don't end up as disappointed and angry as we were.",negative,en,0

"I do not think that this movie deserves the low rating that most will give it. It's one of the best ""teenager"" horror films I've ever seen; and that's saying a lot. Nothing is left without an explanation to back it up, the characters and plot break countless horror movie stereotypes, and it has got nothing to do with some other horrible pieces we've been submitted to lately. (A clear example is the mindless ""Saint Ange"".) The first 30-40 minutes might be downright boring with the exception of the beginning, although some minor light mistakes can be easily spotted. After the arrival to the village, though, the horror -a different, twisted kind of horror- begins.With the plot and the details, goofs are minor; the characters are this movie's strongest point, given that so many clichés are broken in it. For example, the two main male characters, Nick and Wade, are not by any means the idiotic types we're used to; although Dalton might fit better in this stereotype, not is he the only one to pay for this lack of consciousness. Some scenes are truly, satisfyingly horrible, making up for tense moments scattered around all the film. And, in the end, and although everything is decorously explained, it's easy to see that things won't go so easy to the surviving characters.The only errors I can see, and which do not imply continuity (IE, Carly not finding her own cut finger in the unconscious Bo's pockets) is the illumination, which is somehow annoying during the first, boring 30 minutes. Although, plot and effects-wise, everything is drastically and cruelly twisted with the arrival of the main characters to Ambrosia, that little village in the midst of nothing, so I'll give it that. It's been pretty much argued that about 70% of the movie is illogical; ""How can two people build an entire house of wax?"", ""Where do they get all the wax from?"". These wouldn't be uprising questions if people would have paid more attention to the movie. The Sinclair brothers did not build the House of Wax; their mother worked making actual wax figures, and they were exhibited at the museum. And the scenario where Paris Hilton's unfortunate character meets her untimely death is the answer to the second question; what is with all the personal objects (mobile phones, cars, clothes) of the dead people? Using their third brother as a connection with the exterior, it's pretty much arguable that the Sinclair twins should obtain the money necessary to buy the wax, in a WWII-type fashion.So, that aside, I think the movie deserves a lot more than it gets, and nobody should lose the chance to watch it. So go see the House of Wax. Right now.",positive,en,2
"Me and my boyfriend stayed at Hotel 31 for 5 nights. We had a room on the 6th floor with a view of the Empire state building which was nice. We had a room with a shared bathroom and it turned out just fine. The 2 bathrooms on the floor were almost always available (at least one of the two on the floor), and clean. We could have gone to the next floor if they would have been occupied but never had to.
The room itself was pretty basic, a bed, desk, tv, phone and a sink. It was small but totally enough for the two of us. It was clean so we really can't complain about anything, for the price and location it's a very good value.
I can well imagine staying at Hotel 31 again. If you're looking for luxury then you should probably go somewhere else, but if you just need a basic room with a bed and toilet/shower, this is quite enough. Who stays at their hotel room much in NYC anyway?",positive,en,2

The quality is really good & I've been very happy with them for the most part. We've had them several months and of the 4 cables, 3 still work. 1 of the cables, the 6' cable that I keep in my car, has stopped working, intermittently. So, basically what happens (and I've had the same issue on 2 different iPhone 6S phones) is that I'll plug it in and it will not charge. Then I'll disconnect and reconnect and if I do that a few times then sometimes it will finally start to charge. Sometimes I can't get it to work.

"Unfortunately, noise can be a problem in this hotel. The staff are very nice and helpful, but street noise from nighttime roadwork made it impossible to sleep. The rooms are clean, but New York sized (small). The bed is comfortable and the shower good, as other reviews have noted. The TV in the bathroom mirror may seem cool, but it makes the mirror a little hard to use for shorter people (for example, putting on makeup). As with many NYC hotels, the in-room services are bare: no room service, no movies on the TV. One isnt really expected to stay in the room I guess. But after a long day out in the city, it would be nice if one could at least order a drink up from the bar or watch a flick. Maybe the hotel could add some such services.",neutral,en,1

"I finally got around to seeing this after hearing great things about it. It actually exceeded my expectations. Considering the budget involved this was a surprisingly competent and well-made film. The lack of finances actually helped this film in several ways, especially given the plot. Just like The Blair Witch Project, this film was all the better for being shot on video instead of film. Another bonus: Whereas most low-budget horror films (even the best of the best) suffer from mediocre-to-unintentionally hysterical acting, this film actually had a talented cast (save one or two characters), particularly the two leads. The only thing missing from the film was an original storyline. It borrows heavily from better-known films like ""Deliverance"" and ""Wrong Turn"" but if you're like me, films of this nature never cease to be terrifying. Plus, the director keeps things interesting throughout. I'd be very interested to see what the director would do with a bigger budget and I have a feeling it will only be a matter of time before we find out...",positive,en,2

"Like some others, we jumped on the Living Social deal to Vivace. I really have no idea why they threw that bone out there, as I am fairly sure they have no need of it, but since they did, we used it. Definitely glad they did (and that we did).\n\nThe service at Vivace is second to none, as is the scenery, inside and out, though the layout of the interior is a bit odd - perhaps it is those massive red chandeliers from the bizarro Ikea world. Or maybe it is all just a bit disjointed rather than having a nice flow to the place.\n\nThere is what I would call a dining room to the right (with a bar), a bar to the left (with bar tables, but no dining room), and another dining area upstairs (also with a bar). The bar downstairs also has a patio and the dining area upstairs has a balcony.\n\nUnfortunately, each time I have been there, it has been at least overcast outside, if not downright scary, making those outdoor spaces less than ideal. Still, the heaters are nice - it just makes the view less than spectacular. Not their fault, but it does impact the usability.\n\nWhich leaves the food. We found it to be hit and miss. Some items are average, like the meat and cheese platters. Good, but not great. Others, like the fish, have a nice crispy skin in one area, but the same skin is mush elsewhere. Then you get a nice piece of meat, say the short rib, that is tasty, but man is it rich! Had to stop after just a few bites.

"Check-in: \n=====\n\nMy check-in took a bit of time. While the line wasn't long and there were several lines open, it seemed some people were closing their lines. When I finally checked in, I had to pay the resort fee upfront - $67.20 - via debit/credit card. After I was set, the check-in teller provided me a map of the hotel and told me where to find the West Tower, where I was upgraded to (complimentary). \n\nFinding My Room:\n=========== \n\nOkay, so here's the thing... I got lost. I went to the 5th floor with all my bags and walked around the entire pyramid before I realized I didn't go to the West Tower. I had to \n\nMy View: \n======\n\nIn my room... there's none. Oh, look, the slate gray roof from the casino floor. Bwahahahha. \n\nTender: \n=====\n\nI used my $20 food credit to eat here. I had the Pumpkin Ravioli and Baked cookies. Mmm delicious. \n\nBooklet: \n======\n\nUsually booklets are full of crappy coupons that are useless. I used the $20 food and beverage credit I received at check-in and ate dinner at Tender the first night I was there. I had the Pumpkin Raviolo and the fresh baked cookies and ice cream. The credit covered the bill. As much as I wanted meat, I decided to wait until my first \""full\"" day here to find one of the local buffets. Considering 1-21 is my birthday, I planned to eat at MORE because you'll eat all day for $35 there, and I really plan to do nothing but live and love life on this day. There's coupons for all of the restaurants in the Luxor, some of the shoppes and the lovely $5 Tee shirt coupon. \n\n\n\nCASINO: \n========\n\nI'm not much of a gambler, but the floor is cool. I didn't play anything - yet. However, I am highly annoyed by staff members who try to get you to purchase timeshares. I just tell them \""No\"" and keep it moving. A timeshare is not in my plans. Ever. \n\nMY ROOM: \n=========\n\nAs I stated previously I was given an upgraded room. My room is in the West Tower. Unlike the \""basic\"" Luxor rooms, this one is a full room that doesn't have a weird angle that everyone warned me about. To be clear, I wasn't tripping on having an angled room in the first place, but it was very nice to walk into a full bedroom with 2 nicely made full size beds. The decor was creme brulee and a contemporary deep blue. The bathroom had a separate shower and bath - awesome because I'm hitting up Lush to take a nice long, sexy soak as soon as I get the chance. \n\nHOWEVER THERE IS NO VIEW. \n\nYou have to pay for the view ... so my upgrade had me looking at the concrete roof of the casino or something. I don't really think I care about the view ... but if you're interested in a room with a view, just know it will cost more. (Same if you want a room with a \""normal\"" ceiling.) \n\nTHE BATHROOM IS SPACIOUS - BATH TUB AND GLASS SHOWER ARE NEXT TO ONE ANOTHER BUT SEPARATED. : \n\nINTERNET ACCESS: \n================\n\nYou only have a gray wired ethernet cord for your room. At first this bothered and worried me. I thought I'd have to push back my trip and go to another hotel - Tropicana - instead. However, I discovered that the cord actually stretches to one of the beds and even the table in my room. And so, that, coupled with the fact that I'm here alone - it's NOT as BIG of a deal unless your laptop does NOT have an Ethernet hookup. (I have a MacBook pro).",neutral,en,1

"It's sort of a standard issue midtown/renovated/3-4 star hotel. White sheet covered duvet, plenty of pillows, unnecessary bolsters.
That said - some rooms are better than others, although I think all of the bathrooms are the same (would it kill any of these places to put in soaking tubs?). The upper floors have insane views! And depending on which floor and what way your facing, it can be loud at all of the bars in the area's closing time. They do offer ear plugs, so it's not like they're unaware of the issue.

"It's a Walmart. It's a moderate location, not a high-end location but it's generally neat and organized. The evenings/nights tend to show lots of carts in the parking lot so be careful when parking your car. My biggest complaint is that the registers on the general merchandise side of the store are NEVER open which forces everyone to a few registers on the grocery side of the store. The problem with this is always a long wait time. Grocery carts are generally full of many items that take longer to ring (especially if the customer is ad-matching), whereas general merchandise carts have fewer items that can be rung faster. This is the only Walmart I've shopped that doesn't have registers open on both sides of the store to help separate the type of carts/customers.\n\nI need to give credit to the store manager. Several months ago, I sent an email to her regarding my experience with a group asking for money at the doors. This was a community group that likely had approval to be there but this one in particular had many people crowding the entry way and actively blocked my way twice while I had my son on one arm, bags on the other, and my daughter by my side. I've not seen groups blocking the entry ways again after that.",negative,en,0

"I am not sure which hotel some of the other reviewers stayed in- they referred to this hotel as 'the best"" they have stayed in, and ""spectacular"". Nope. This hotel has a lot of good points and a lot of not so great points. Just average.
Good points: Great location- we did not rent a car- we walked or took the metro everywhere. there is a circulator route one block away, and it is reliable and cheap.
Nice to have a suite- separate sleeping room was a bit more sound proof than the living area
Managers reception and breakfast- much more at this reception than some of the other embassy suites i have stayed at, and the breakfast was vey good. if you go early enough, the lines arent that bad, but as the morning goes on, or on the weekend, it can take 30 minutes for cook to order food
Clean rooms and very helpful staff- especially housekeeper on our floor who went out of her way to help us when our door lock broke and we couldnt get in our room
Safe-- seemed to be in a safe area- but no in room safes
Starbucks on corner--enough said
Bad points:
very dated hotel- carpets have definitely seen better days, and in some spots the wallpaper was peeling off of the walls. the furniture in the suite had ink drawings all over it from previous guests and the dressers had many markings all over them
very noisy- this hotel had a ton of families, and they were not the kind that were considerate of guests that were looking for peace and quiet. the walls are thin and we could hear the very loud guests mosts nights-- also construction going on across the street that seemed to go on into the night and very early in the morning. not a good place to stay if you are looking for a peaceful nights sleep
weak water pressure in shower- shower had a nice curved shower rod, so it was roomy, but the water pressure was very weak and the ""adjustable"" shower head was broken and stuck on a weak setting",negative,en,0

"One of my favorite places to get those specialty sandwiches or bakery items, and they have incredibly delicious soups. We frequent Kneaders about every two to three weeks. Tonight was one of those \""Arizona chilled to the bone\"" kind of nights perfect for some of their soup. Apparently the cashier made a mistake with the order before us because the manager started reprimanding her, in front of us (!!!!), and then proceeded to assume that we were the people who ordered those items on the ticket when we hadn't even been given the chance to speak our order to her yet. She did great handling it though, and didn't seem to let it frazzle her.\nThe food and food service is not why I rated Kneaders a 3-stars however. There was a worker in a red sweater who was helping with gift wrap. I was intrigued by a giant mug but it contained no price. I respectfully asked if she could inform me. She snapped and said \""well, when I'm done I can look it up for you!\"" Taken aback, I said OK I will go get me a drink and come back. I came back and she seriously took another 20 minutes to \""gift wrap\"" and chat it up with the guest whom she was helping. After five minutes I just sat down and waited. After she finished, I assumed she would come back to answer my question. Nope, new customers. So I approach, said excuse me 3 times and loudly, and she IGNORED ME! I decided if they didn't want to pay me any attention then I didn't want to buy the giant mug and teapot from them. Huge disappointment in this area. If she had just answered me even that last time, I wouldn't have been so frustrated that she took SO long with the first two customers!! It seems overpriced anyway because one teapot was seriously $30. Yah it was adorable, and probably handmade, but $30???? Don't buy anything but food from them here. That's where their service is anyway.",negative,en,0

"Very low-budget police procedural film about homicide detectives trying to solve the murder of a woman whose body turns up in a stolen car in Central Park, and their only clue is a tattoo on her arm. Although released by RKO, this has the look of an independent production that was picked up by the studio for distribution. The cast and crew, with a few exceptions--among them a young and uncredited Jack Lord, director Edward Montagne and cameraman William Steiner--are comprised of complete unknowns, and it shows. The performances are universally sub-par and wouldn't pass muster in a high school training film, the direction is stodgy and choppy and, as mentioned previously, there's no chemistry whatsoever between the lead actors. However, despite the film's many shortcomings, it does have a few good points. The location shooting in New York City, and the film's ultra-low budget, gives it a gritty authenticity much like that of the far superior ""The Naked City"", a shootout in a dark basement is decently handled, and some of the investigating procedures are clever. Otherwise, it's not much to write home about. It is worth a look, however, for a glimpse at the seamier sections of New York City in the early 1950s, and old-car buffs will be ecstatic to see the legions of '30s and '40s cars in the streets..",negative,en,0
"I think this course is the best entry into the concepts of ML you can find. Andrew Ng is a wonderful, passionate teacher and explains most concepts in a way that is easy to grasp. I liked the emphasis on supervised learning and taking time to explain the very foundation with linear regression, logistic regression in great detail. When you look around the internet everyone is talking about cNN, Deep Learning, GANs, ... but the truth is - you first need to get your foundation right before moving on the more advanced topics. ML is actually a lot of mathematics, stochastic - so getting initial knowledge about these topics is important. Some things in the course where not that well explained, for example Back Propagation.

My mom came in town this weekend and I took her here Friday morning. She had it, said it was the best breakfast she ever had, then asked if I wanted to go again Saturday morning, and she ordered the same exact thing.\nAlso, their lemonades are really tasty mixed with iced tea. They have mint in them. It's yummy. Their hash browns are good. You can also get tator tots, which taste like tator tots from anywhere else...but tator tots are always good. \nIt is small and does get crowded on weekends, but the wait is generally fast even if you have lots of parties in front of you, because they tend to turn over tables quickly. There's actually a note at the bottom of their menu that essentially reads \""When you're done spending money, get the eff out.\"" Okay, it actually says something about being polite and cognizant of the people waiting for a table, but I don't think my interpretation was very far off.\nThe meals are about $8-$10/each, which is a little pricey for breakfast, but the quality is good and the menu is more varied than you would find at a Denny's or IHOP, so I think it's worth it.

MORE, though, is terrific, a great 60s drug movie and, simply, an important document of its time.

The bowtie bolgnese pasta is very good and even though the menu says spicy suace - it was not spicy for any of us and we hate spicy dishes. Also we sent the veggie pita back, was not to appetizing and enjoyed the chicken salad sandwich with the sides of salad and sweet potato fries.

I had 3 Dunkels in big barrel glasses, the price is very fair and the beer was great! The bartenders are very fast even when the bar is jam packed! \n\nThe dance/music portion is highly disappointing. Cheap Thrills is supposed to be a combination of Shake DJ's and Party Foul... I was excited, as I love DJ William Reed and Jared Allen. Unfortunately William never took to the decks, and I was there from 11 till 2ish. The kids who were up there played terrible trance techno type stuff that was undancable and I felt like I was at a rave in someones basement and needed a pair of glow sticks. I was really looking forward to hearing some old Shake music in the mix, it never happened. Maybe this dance night is no longer a collaboration of the two, as William never spun that night. I dunno. I should add, that my taste in music is pretty terrible.

I also go the fruit and greek yogurt filled crepes, which was perfect for Saturday morning brunch. I didn't leave full, but I wanted a light brunch, which was exactly what I'd gotten.

Its exterior hides a rather reasonable size interior- by no means as big as its dominant neighbour the Pear Tree.

"My wife and I decided to book a room at the Downtown Courtyard with our young daughter. I remain very loyal to the Marriott brand hotels since I collect the Marriott ""Rewards"". This hotel did not look anything like a typical Courtyard Inn. It was nothing elegant or fancy from the exterior. The lobby was very presentable and the employees were all extremely polite. The bell captain was quick to load all of our luggage and quickly had everything to our room. He offered us his name and made himself available with directions and reservations as needed. I was quite impressed.The suite consisted of a room with two double beds and a seperate living room. There was also a small refrigerator and sink along with microwave. Prior to arriving I called the hotel direct and asked them if it was possible to switch my suite for a suite with a king bed instead of two double beds. They responded that this was not available based on the package I selected. I was quite disappointed. They never even discussed an additional charge or a way to ensure my satisfaction. I questioned Marriotts commitment to guest satisfaction at this point but chose not to pursue it.I slept on the double bed and was not overly comfortable. I am a good size guy and am used to sleeping on a king. Well anyways I made do. The other issue of concern was that when I checked in I had reminded the front desk clerk that I needed a crib in the room. We had left to go have dinner and when we arrived the portable crib was left for us unassembled. I would expect that when you are travelling and request a crib it would be assembled and made up as would any type of bed. The hotel however does have a nice swimming pool. The water was refreshing and it seemed well maintained. We ate breakfast in the hotel restaurant. They have a very nice buffet along with an omellette station. Good quality food served! My only other comment is that on both nights that we stayed at this hotel it seemed extremely noisy outside. Tons of sirens from firetrucks and ambulances. I stayed on the eleventh floor and was quite disturbed by the noise. Perhaps this is the norm at Chicago hotels. It is a bustling city! Anyways the location is good and the price was reasonable for the dowtown Chicago area. We took advantage of one of the shopping/weekend packages on Marriott. and booked this particular hotel room.",positive,en,2
"This is a great addition to the area. I am glad we have another choice where to go for mom's night out. It is a cute place with and interesting menu and wines.

That was my latest discovery in Oregon and is one of my new favorites. I couldn't believe they have it, since it comes from such a small winery in Oregon. I loved the Shallot marmalade bruschetta, it was very tasty. The salmon roll was really good too. On Mondays they have a deal for a chef's choice pizza and a bottle of their wine for $20. When I went with my hubby for Happy Hour, we had the sliders, they were very tasty. Good place to hang out and my hubby could have his margarita since they have a pretty full bar.",neutral,en,1

La Mansion is right on the River Walk, and a stone's throw from the Alamo, very convenient. We parked in the garage directly across the street, and a couple of times (Friday & Saturday nights) wished we had utilized the valet, as the garage charges flat rates on weekends, then will charge you more in the morning if you don't get your car out by 8am. The bar inside the hotel was inviting and cozy, and the bartender certainly knows how to make a drink without charging an arm & a leg!

Kuala Lumpur to Langkawi. Today we tried to cancel flights for this weekend to Langkawi due to the latest Movement Restriction Order in Malaysia. We live at Genting Highlands and the Government is telling everyone to remain at home to help stop the spread of Covid-19. Malindo Air only offered to give back approximately 80rm on tickets which were purchased for approximately 1200rm. Given the crisis the world is facing at present I believe this is inappropriate and totally unfair that Malindo Air are not supporting the government’s orders on the current restrictions.,negative,en,0

"I stayed here on business for a month. The hotel is nice and the rooms are clean. If you want a fridge, you must request it. The gym is great, with new machines and a lot of equipment. There is no free wi-fi, which was a great hindrance for someone on business.
While the hotel is nice, I would not recommend the area. Other than the convenience of being very close to Union Station, there is nothing ideal about the neighborhood. It is one block from the homeless shelter, and as a young woman staying on her own in a strange town, I did not feel safe walking around alone. There are not many good food choices nearby either. I always had to travel a little far out of my way to get any good food. It is 2 stops away from Chinatown or a 20 minute walk, but Chinatown does not have good restaurants anyway.
The hotel is also far away from any grocery stores, which may not matter for vacationers, but could make a difference to those with extended stay. I was here for a month. The closest grocery store was Safeway, which was a 3 block walk to the bus stop, a bus ride, and then another 3-4 block walk. It was also not in a good area, since a homeless man followed and sang to me the entire time. Yes, he sang loudly at me when I would not let him carry my groceries.
I only stayed here because it was close to work. Factoring the hotel alone, I would rate it as above-average. But due to the location, I would knock down my rating. I would not stay here again just for that reason alone. That aside, the service and staff were ok. And being so close to Union Station, there is no problem hailing a cab, no matter the time.",negative,en,0

Most distressing was the lack of internal lock - I put the luggage rack and my suitcase in front of the door to feel slightly more secure - especially given the amount of noise that seeps in from the hallway. (Several times it seemed like someone was standing right outside my door.)

The ambience is great, nice big windows, and plenty of space - neighbouring tables area very comfortable distance away, so you don't ever feel crowded. Try to get a table near a window at the front. The first Champagne cork pops at 12 noon and it's free flow till last pour just before 3. It's a fantastic way to spend a Sunday afternoon on occasion.

"I don't usually dig Mexican food so I wasn't too thrilled when my husband suggested we give this place a try. He was suckered in by the large glass windows and the restaurant's location, perched high atop a mountain overlooking the Vegas valley. (The view did NOT disappoint, by the way! It's a great place to take out of town visitors to impress them with a stunning view). \n\nThe restaurant is large and spacious. The hostess was super friendly, and you walk in right by the open kitchen. The menu is large with all sorts of interesting and creative dishes (I got a chicken breast cooked with sweet peppers and topped with cream and it was amazingly tasty). I also asked if I could have veggies instead of rice and beans and they said no problem and were very accommodating! All dinners come with freshly made flour tortillas (sooooo yummy), rice & beans (or a vegetable medly of mushrooms, onions, zucchini and peppers if you ask), and a pretty dang good cup of soup (tomato broth with noodles). Another big plus is that they serve Pepsi products. Nothing's better than a fizzy Diet Pepsi on a hot day!\n\nThe complimentary corn chips, salsa and bean dip were nothing to write home about, but we managed to gobble down almost the entire basket. The food really is \""Mexican gourmet\"" as advertised. The ingredients tasted fresh and the options inspired. There are also standard items for picky eaters (tacos, quesadillas, fajitas). \n\nThe best thing about this place is the service! We had TOP NOTCH service, better service than we have had in some of the fancy places in town! I kid you not. We never had to ask for anything or needed anything. It was amazing.

"I was very optimistic to experience the ""Roosevelt"" during a busy summer weekend. However, my experience was awful. The hotel's elevators were broken the entire weekend which resulted in a 20 minute waiting period to take my bags up to the room and several trip up and down the stairs to the 8th floor. The staff was also very unaccommodating. I got the feeling that they didn't care if we enjoyed our stay or were satisfied because they would have guests no matter what because of their name and didn't care if we ever returned, which we wouldn't anyways. They also would not allow more than 2 guests per a room at the pool, which only has 90 chairs for the 700 guests to boot. If you wanted a chair you had to get up a dawn and sit in your chair for the entire day or else you would lose it. If you expect to lay out or party at the pool, it is very difficult to do. The hotel also allows their ""guests"" aka, people who greased the pool bouncers and front desk people, to be at the pool making it even more crowded and much harder to get a $15 drink. Don't stay here, you will be disappointed. This is not only my opinion, but many other people who were staying there at the same time also spoke this way and said they would never stay there again. Being a guest also does not give you any priority at the door for Teddy's or the Tropicana Bar. Use your money elsewhere.",negative,en,0

So we made the choice, we left our baggage behind and continue on our way. HOWEVER, at this point, another hour sitting on the plane waiting, the pilots are about to timeout. They quickly push back to get into the air, but need to de-ice first. Fine, whatever. We go to take off, the pilot aborts the first take-off attempt and we sit and wait yet again for him to figure out his problem. We FINALLY take off on the second attempt, and it is 6 hours from when we're originally supposed to take off. As for the lost baggage, we finally received our baggage that they left behind on Monday, Saturday. We reached out to customer service every day with Ridiculous hold times, told us they would call us back numerous times, but NEVER did. Finally we received an email with a lost baggage checklist, then they shipped it. Now as for on the way home. Everything went smoother this time, but we still were an hour and a half delayed. Overall terrible experience. Terrible customer service. I don't care about the price, pay more money for another airline and get a seamless experience.",negative,en,0
"Goodwiches and Good-location!\n\nThe wifie and I decided to check out the Goodwich after hearing so many good things about this place. We ordered the Foie and the Le Pig. Both were excellent sandwiches and were well thought out. \n\nLet's start with the Le Pig. This had a great balance of both flavor and texture. The lime ginger radish\\slaw went well with the rich pork and the crunchy texture of the chicharones made it all come together. It somewhat reminded me of a torta (Mexican sandwich) without the beans. \n\nThe Foie was a little bit more interesting. The Foie pate was paired with somewhat of a cabbage jam which made it a little sweet and chicken skin which again added the crispy texture. In my opinion I would have added a few more extra pieces of chicken skin as it got masked by the strong flavor of the foie. I would recommend getting either their house pickles or their pickled beets along with this sandwich to cut through the richness of the sandwich.\n \nI want to come back and try a few of their other sandwiches, maybe even create my own (fried egg with lots of chicken skin and bacon) mmmm I can feel my heart slowing down.\n \nIf you're looking for a late night spot to go after a few drinks downtown this would be the perfect place to satisfy your cravings.",neutral,en,1
"Well - two stars for the food and maybe 3-4 for the service. \nI just can't bring myself to give them 3 stars to even it out. \n\nWe came here because it was highly recommended to us by a friend - which I will never trust again. \n\nThe food was...not good. It was a notch below mediocre...\n\nWe started off with the combo appetizer platter - the only thing that was good was the dill sauce. Everything else was okay and somewhat bland or over-fried. \n\nFor dinner, we had -\n\nChicken Curry - Man, I don't know what they use in this curry other than some kind of bland curry and nutmeg. It wasn't even very spicy as I requested. It was so bad, I couldn't even finish my dish...even though I was hungry. \nAlso, they use precooked basmati rice...??? I don't understand any restaurant that uses precooked rice. I'm half Asian. I know when rice isn't fresh. I eat that shit every day. \n\nLamb, beef and chicken kabobs - same thing. That rice...oh, that rice. And the kabobs were alright. I give them 3 stars. But, they were not that pleasing to the taste buds. \n\nI don't know. The server was good, but very oddly quiet...like we had to listen in very closely to hear what he was saying. He was prompt though. \n\nI do not recommend this place. It's outdated and maybe it was good at one time. If so, they've taken a turn for the worst. There are many other places in town that beat out this place, hands down.",negative,en,0
"If I was judging on ambiance alone, this place would easily get 5 stars. It used to be our go-to place to bring out of towners for a nice night out to dinner (pre-Graze). And truly, I have not had a bad dinner here (though I will always miss the skate wing!). My issue with this place comes with the Brunch. The best service we have received for brunch has been \""acceptable\"". What I don't understand is why their brunch chef cannot cook an egg. I enjoy the yolk runny, and I guess the only way to get them this way is to specify barely over easy or sunny side up. Poached was almost hard boiled, and even when I asked specifically if the baked eggs had runny yolks, I got overcooked eggs. And for the prices here, I expect more. I'll still go here for dinner, but there are a ton of other places in Madison I will be frequenting for Brunch.",negative,en,0

"Maybe my expectations for a New York hotel were too low, but the Hampton Inn really impressed me. While the room wasn't incredibly spacious, I found it quite large for (what I expected of) New York City. The furnishings were nice, and the room was very clean. While others have stated the perks, I'll reinforce some of them: free internet (our room had wired and wireless), free coffee/tea (24/7), a nice breakfast spread (and breakfast-to-go on the weekdays!), and free apples (random, but nice). I took the Amtrak into town, and the hotel was only a $6 cab ride away from Penn Station.
More importantly, however, I found the staff to be incredibly helpful. Each staff member seemed to enjoy their work, and they were incredibly helpful on several occasions.
This was my first New York hotel stay, and I was wary of the accommodations. However, I was ultimately quite pleased with the Hampton. I will definitely stay there again.",positive,en,2

"Been here several times and each time I am greeted with the same warm smiles. For some odd coincidence, both times I was looking for costumes. Long story short........TOGA PARTY! Ok, maybe one of them was a toga party. Anyways, these guys here seem to know what they are doing because for every question I had, they were able to help me and lead me to the right section.\n\nMy second time coming here I had to find a costume for my son. As you can see from some of the pics, he was looking at masks and weird hat combinations. Needless to say we ended up ordering a master chief outfit for he has the helmet for it. Maybe I can put him to work on the strip getting tips form tourists taking pics with him.\n\nI gotta say this place is probably one of the bigger locations. They keep it well kept and organized.

"You know those films that are blatantly awful but you can't help but love them? Well that's what Evil Ed is, possibly the best awful film in the world. The sound is rubbish, the dubbing is crap, the screenplay is nonsense and the special effects are pap. However, I can't help but love this film dearly and I have recommended it to at least 50 people over the years. Sam Campbell (or the guy who plays him) should be featured on the Actor's Studio series as he is that memorable. Possibly the greatest movie villain not named Tony Montana. Seriously, if you don't expect a lot then you won't be disappointed. Keep a light-hearted approach to watching this film and you'll soon rate it a ten afterwards.",positive,en,2

"Excellent subject taught excellently. I would go to sleep at night listening to the lectures as if they were the perfect bedtime story. But then Id have to flip back a few lectures in the morning for a close-listening because I didnt want to miss a single nugget of information.Prof. Covach does what a lot of books and courses on the Beatles fail to do. He looks straight at the music and brings in biography and history where necessary. But its the music that provides the beat to this course. Prof. Covach digs deep into songs to provide insight on song form/shape, lyrics, theme, etc. and then ties those observations together with songs that come later in the course. So you get a sense of the Beatles growth as songwriters. What were they influenced by? What did they repeat? How did they alter that repeated form? What conventions did they fall back on when they needed to write a hit single.Though the course does delve into some music theory, its accessible to the layperson, eg, talking about a flatted seventh used in a John song. Hocus pocus talk for non-musicians but the professor explains it in such a way that it makes sense and becomes the thing you listen for when you go to the song on your iTunes.Could there be a better gift for a music lover than this course? Well, the professor has a couple other offers on Coursera. Maybe Ill check them out and compare. Ill get back to ya.",positive,en,2

"The word ""boring"" gets thrown around way too often when referring to exactly how bad a low-budget Horror movie might, or might not be. I've seen many a B-movie. Many horrible, terribly inept B-movies. Some with a production value of a few hundred bucks. Does ineptness, lousy acting, worse continuity, and embarrassing budgets really make a movie unwatchable? Some would no doubt way yes. Most of which are probably huge fans of The Matrix. Well, I hate big-budget movies, so I say no. Bad can sometimes be funny (Blood Freak), sometimes even mind-blowing (Troll 2), but Boring will always be unwatchable... Hey, kinda like Bloodthirsty Butchers, which reminds me, I'm writing a review for this pile of garbage... Uh, yeah, anyway. This is one of late British director Andy Milligan's many alternatives to sleeping pills. This one is based on Sweeney Todd... Great. Milligan takes a boring story, and still manages to ""butcher"" it. Hey, that's pretty funny, I said bu... sorry, I keep getting distracted. This isn't exactly easy. On second thought, I'll make it easy. No gore, no scares, no entertainment, just unlikeable, annoying people having incoherent conversations. that's Bloodthirsty Butchers. Oh yeah, and something about a barber killing people, and something or other about meat pies. I don't know, it's not important.For something a little more rewarding from Andy Milligan, there's always the only other one I've seen, The Rats Are Coming, The Werewolves Are Here. Yeah, you heard me. But hows about we forget about this Milligan guy all together, and pick up something sweet like Sick Girl or Teenape Goes To Camp. Whatever you decide, just know, Bloodthirsty Butchers sucks, possibly even more than any other version of this already lackluster tale. And that, B-movie fans, is really saying something. 2/10",negative,en,0

"I was much looking forward to staying here at The W, Washington but I think it was over hyped. There were two doormen on duty but I had to open my own door - through two sets, not that I mind opening my own doors but when you have two doormen stood there doing nothing but talking and you have two very large suitcases you'd expect them to open the doors for you, especially for the hotelier in question.
I arrived at the front desk and I was blunted asked ""can I help you?"" - giving me the impression that they thought I was in the wrong place. I then told them I was checking in, their attitudes promptly changed - even offering me a complimentary hot drink.
I checked in and went up to my room via the lift. To operate the lift you just hold you key card up to the card reader - which is easy and very convenient, not like some lifts where you have to insert a card into a reader to operate it - most troublesome if your hands are full.
I found my room only to find I had been allocated a disabled room - which is not a problem. The bathroom had a shower only but the bathroom itself was quite small considering it was a disabled room - the shower was small too, not much room to move around in there if you are in a wheelchair in my opinion.
The room was nice and clean, but the room was rather small too. The hotel is situated close to the monuments which was nice.
I went out to check the area out and upon returning later that night, they had the lobby area pumping with music and parts of it was sectioned off for a private function. I made my way to the lift, only again, for a burly man to stop me in my tracks and ask if I was going to the rooftop party or if I was a guest. I told them I was a guest and he demanded to see my room card key. He then let me through when I complied.
The noise wasn't too apparent from my room - considering they were having a party.
On a good note, they offer you one complimentary ride - you book in and they take you where you want to go (with restrictions) - this is a nice gesture. You just have to watch a short marketing video in their cars - where they try to tell you of the benefits of buying the car you are riding in. If anything, if you're not looking for a new car, just take a free ride, beats taking a taxi!

"...and it is this film. I imagine that if indeed there is a negative afterlife, damned souls are tied to a rather uncomfortable couch and forced to watch this movie on a continuous loop for all eternity. Okay, maybe it's not that bad, but it is probably the worst film I have ever seen next to ""Manos, the Hands of Fate""... and I have seen a lot of bad movies, believe you me. This is just a crummy B movie, bad film-making at it's finest(or is it worst?) The thing I really didn't like about this movie is the moronic duo they threw in for comedy relief. Now, a little comedy relief is a good thing, but most of the movie is focused on the adventures of these two morons, rather than on the ""heroes"" of this film, who are actually in it for less time than them! To be fair, Crown International really destroyed the movie by adding bad music and doing a poor job editing. But honestly, this was probably a bad film to begin with, so Crown really couldn't have done that much to hurt it. This really needs to be in the bottom 100 list. I wouldn't wish this one on my worst enemy. Actually, it's my kind of campy B movie. It was bad, but I still liked it, despite my one star rating.",negative,en,0

Only four people on my flight so we sat where we liked. Checking in was therefore a formality. As it was a small propeller plane it felt like getting on a private jet (albeit quite worn inside and shared with others). No cabin crew on board (no need for a 45 min journey to Edmonton).

I booked based on the generally good feedback I found on nthe net and the relative cheapness.
Our first room was on the top floor and right on the corner. there is a traffic lighted crossroads outside which was, as you would expect, very noisy. The room was extremely hot which meant we had to have the window open leading to mad levels of noise during the night. I spoke with the impersonal female receptionist (I'm not sure she's suited to this kind of work) who was more concerned about making excuses than trying to help. After approaching her for a 2nd time we were moved to a 1st level room that was bigger, cooler and less noisy.

"After visiting Chi-town a couple years ago, I was suprised to see a large number of take out joints and carryout's advertising an item known as an \""italian beef\"". Upon further investigation by way of the Food Network and Google, I found out that this is the Chicago state dish along with the Chicago style pizza. While I never had the opportunity to try this item in Chicago, I was pleasantly surprised that a Chicago style eatery had opened near my house.\n\n#13 Windy City Combo - A Chicago style Italian Beef and Sausage Sandwich\nOrdered this because I wanted to try an italian beef, but also wanted to try it with an Italian Sausage. Also wanted it \""extra wet\"" to give it that authentic experience. The roast beef was extremely tender and flavorful with hints of garlic and spices. The italian sausage was flavorful with a little kick to it as well. And the roll was juicy due to the sandwich being dunked in a beef broth. All in all, it was a great sandwich.\n\nI will be back to try the Chicago style Pizza, great experience here!",neutral,en,1

"First time at this Hyatt property, as a Diamond HGP, received an upgraded suite... it was a massive hotel room... separate living room, sleeping area, hallway with with a lot of closets, and huge bathroom. Included a 'pantry' area with microwave, sink, near full size refrigerator (all items comp except for beer and liquor), and nepresso coffee machine. A few quirks though in this room... the light controls were 'touch pads' and aside from being senstive to the touch (turning lights on/off that we didn't want), the control pad for the bath room was in the hallway, which meant hunting down the halllway in the dark to find it, press it and peeking into the bathroom to find out if on or not (w/o bathing the sleeping area in light). Also, there is no door between the WC and the rest of the bathroom... so when one of us had to use the loo, the other had to leave the bathroom (did i mention that the bathroom is huge, so in theory, more than one person should be able to use at once). As a note, no newspaper is delivered to the room (which was odd as when i was walked to the room by someone from the staff, they asked me for my newspaper preference). Wonderful location if one wants to spend time in mid-town, which is exactly what we wanted to do.",positive,en,2

"We agree with the previous reviews. Here is what we saw;
1) Homeless people all around the hotel, sitting in the grass, begging in the trafic, Just generally hanging around the place. Not the hotel's fault I know, but it gives the area a bad feel.
2) Wireless Internet did not work, after calling the help desk and changing all the settings on the laptop (and we had to change them back when we got home), it was discovered that the router had to be rebooted. it worked for about 4 hours then malfunctioned again. We gave up with the internet at this point. There are no cables to borrow from the front desk as advertised in the brochures.
3) The girl outside seemed to be overworked as she was never at the desk when we went to get assistance. When she did turn up, she was very abrupt (but never rude) and looked overloaded.
4) The property in the back is well kept. The pool was nice.

"If this was a short story to draw the reader into the series - it FAILED big time.Nissa goes to a Vampire club because she wants sex with a vampire and to ultimately become a Vampire herself - (maybe because she is lonely, not really explained). The author tells you that Nissa is drawn to the club and to Hex & Aleron. The reader is then told after days of having sex in every way possible in a menage that love now exists. At that point - all I could do was think - well, that's nice - didn't ever feel the love but whatever.I like stories with a high ""heat"" factor but I also want well-developed plots with interesting characters and interactions.In this novella:- Dialogue was flat- Characters one dimensional- No originality- The plot is ????? - not sure if there is one- Sex scenes read more like a ""how to"" book than an erotic scene- Rushed HEA - they had sex and then the reader is told that they are in love - didn't really feel itThe short story was mostly pages after pages of the three having sex but I would describe it as just graphic rather than erotic and definitely not sizzling. If you want a very short ""how to"" book on a few of the different ways to have sex - then this book is for you. Not very imaginative but it does contain some of the standard ways found in countless of erotica books that are more original and better developed.",negative,en,0

It's even cheaper if you make friends with someone who already paid for bottle service at their table. We worked both of those avenues and it paid off pretty well.\n\nI'm a little bummed that I didn't get to see a drag show (that's more my issue than theirs, though).

"We had a horrible stay at this hotel. I heard from locals that the owners had been trying for 4 years to get this place open...and I think they needed another 4 years to be ready. Management and operation fail often. The worst part was the new years eve party that we were unaware was going to occur in the hotel. I'm not a debbie downer on parties, but if your building is unable to contain noise properly in certain locations, you need to rethink the party, or warn guests in advance and allow them to change their plans. You could hear the noise and music EVERYWHERE in the hotel until 2am. For those of us there for the Sun Bowl game and with an early morning flight out, this was AWFUL. My attempts to get the music turned down resulted in 3 visits to the front desk to talk to the manager and 2 visits to the party to talk to security. Additionally their valet operation is joke, the valets are never around and calling down in advance never helped. When returning from my NYE dinner, the valets appeared to have been enjoying the party themselves. I noted that they did not put an identifying tag on my keys when they took them, I even reminded them that they needed to do that. Sure enough, the next morning (when I had an early flight mind you) it took 20 minutes for the hotel to find my car. And actuall I had to find the keys....they opened up a drawer of untagged keys and asked me which were mine! I should have left the Nissan and taken the BMW. They have done some work to make the hotel look nice and give it character. But the service is maybe 2-star at best. Maybe it will get better. The fact that nothing was offered to me (comp a dinner at least!) despite management being very aware of how justifiably upset I was tells me they know nothing about true customer service at this point.",negative,en,0

"This place is pretty basic eating for your casino cafe dining. I prefer this to the Coco's across the street at Texas Station only because at least here I know I won't be ignored. The staff is usually friendly and you can see that they try really hard to make the most of your meal, even if you order off the 2-4-6-8 menu. I never feel like they judge me even when I order like a real cheepo. \n\nThe last time I went in, I ordered something and all was fine until the server said they no longer had that item. Okay, I order something else heavily modified because the lack of ingredients. Again a few minutes later she comes back and says they were also out of that. (It was a holiday themed meal, it's the holiday season, so now I'm a little miffed.) So I order the same thing as what my husband has ordered, not really knowing what's in it, only knowing it has turkey and that's what I want. \n\nThe food comes out in little spurts because now the cook is really confused, so says the server. We split the first sandwich and by the time the second comes I'm done. It was just too greasy for me. Later on after waiting a while for the check we just get up to pay seeing if they could print out the check up front. They were able to but it was wrong, still having what I had first ordered on it. The hostess begins to fix it and at this time the server comes up and they proceed to get into an argument about it because of the mix up the server doesn't want to charge me at all and the hostess is just not going to let that fly. \n\n I didn't care either way, it was nice of the server to try, but it wasn't like I was completely void of a meal. Still eighteen dollars for two sandwiches seems steep for me especially at Denny's no less. It's okay, this trip was a little off, but I've had better here before so I will probably be back.",negative,en,0

We stayed at this hotel Jan 28 for one night. We traveled from Dallas to Reno and drove from Reno to San Fran (great drive by the way) 4 hour drive! And we stopped in Napa Valley and Sonoma on the way... awesome views and the mountains were amazing!
HOTEL: Rooms are very small... v-e-r-y! But Clean. I thought it was decorated nicely for the space allowed. Honestly we felt like we were on a cruise ship in a cabin! That would be best way to describe the hotel/room. If you weren't planning to spend ANY time in your room this would be okay. Which we weren't but simply stating. My husband hated this hotel. Which is so odd for him. He's not a picky guy at all. I'm not sure why ... other than rooms being so tiny and especially and not worth the price. I would say if you were on a budget this would be the place to stay, but we got our room for one night for $99 on price-line. I think they run around $150 per night. This might just be the case for all of San Fran? The city is huge but jammed packed! Big time city living? I did ask at check in for a room with a view and he said there was none and didn't just mean avail. The hotel has no views at all. Which made me giggle. Its literally a block from the bay... but clearly not a sky rise hotel. Again, this was our first time to visiting San Fran. I will say the location is perfectly located in Fisherman's wharf by Pier 39 which was great for us to walk and sight see for the day. Having only being there once and just for the day I can't say much about the area ... maybe another day. Not really caring to go back though.",neutral,en,1

"Sound quality was a deal-breaker for me (returned them)
First off, I returned these after trying them for a few days. The sound quality just wasn't what I consider adequate. I am giving them three stars though as they did pair easily and function well otherwise. The buttons on them don't control the volume which actually is a good thing - your iPhone is supposed to do that and ones that have it on the cord sort of run at cross-purposes. The speaker element is a bit big but I still was able to cram it into my little ears. And with the smallest set of silicone earbuds that came with it, these fit snuggly in my narrow ear canals. I bought these because for Christmas last year I got a similar product for my daughter and they work great and sound spectacular (great bass and good reproduction all the way up to the treble range). However, I just got a iPhone 11 Pro Max and it doesn't pair with the older BlueTooth for some reason (get with it Apple and fix this!). So I went for these BT 5.0 ones and it did pair nicely. But the sound quality was really noticeably lacking especially when I compared them to the same songs on my daughter's setup (iPhone X + $19 sport headphones). I even made sure to play with the EQ settings on both so they matched. The ""small speaker"" setting seemed the best for these but even that couldn't boost what was required to get things sounding decent. Mostly there was distortion in the frequencies that were lacking if boosted. I listen to music at probably just slightly over normal volume but not ""blasting""... so this is not normally a problem for me. For around $15 they are likely just o.k. I just hoped for more and would have gladly paid 2x that price to get it. So I am back on the hunt...",neutral,en,1

The second star is for the first lady I chatted with on the phone who was extremely polite, helpful, and informative as well as the guy at the sales counter who was very willing to share information about what's required to purchase and own a gun.\n\nThe missing three stars are due to the fact that when I called and asked about buying a package or multiple people to share, I was told the Family Package or Best Bang Package would be best for our party of 3 people to share. I printed out the \""Family package\"" and took the paper with me where it clearly states, \""4 people max\"" ( <url> ) When we got there, however, the woman working the counter said that it's a 4 person MINIMUM. Now, this is exactly OPPOSITE of what it said on the paper in front of me AND on the website. So she \""went to ask her manager\"" and supposedly, we could not share this package with only 3 people. This is absolutely unacceptable and false advertising. Then, even though I had printed out the coupon for $10 off, and it said \""one per person\"" they would only let ONE of use it, and not the two of us who ended up shooting (Our third guest just ended up watching because it was too expensive without sharing a package.) \n\nI do have to agree with the other Yelper who said it's a tourist trap-- it really is. The price-to-duration of entertainment is extremely poor. It took us less than 10 minutes to blow through $300 ($150/package with 4 guns each, 8 guns total.) So, it's really not a good deal at all.

When I arrived there first I had to lift my suitcase up some stairs to get into the hotel. My room was on the fifth floor 521 and in the hall it smelled like beer, incredible. The next day they sprayed some perfume to mask it but then it was too late, I was already disgusted by the smell. The worst thing was the airconditioning. It was making the noise of a plane taking off and it was right next to your head, making it impossible to sleep. One could say put your head on the other side of the bed but then the airco was blowing into your face which was terrible as well. One could say well turn it off then, but that was a no go with 99 degrees outside. There was no sink in the room so I had to do everything in the shared bathroom. This was very very small with a toilet and a shower and nothing to put your stuf except for 2 very very small hooks on the door. so I had to put my toilettries on the toilet :-(.

"We stayed for one night. Hotel is nice and clean. But the front desk was not as I expected from the Hilton chain. We made a reservation for a room with a view (those rooms are more expensive ) and made a request for a high floor. On arrivle we were being told that we will get a back room no view since the hotel is full. When I told the front desk lady that I payed more for that type of room , she said all the rooms are the same price... Only after I insisted that it's not correct , she called the manager at that moment and he admitted it was their mistake but, we still couldn't get the room we reserved . They compensated us with free breakfast But we felt very bad with the front desk attitude at the beginning . The room without the empire state building was fine all looked clean and new. Hotel location is good for touring the city. Beds are too soft.",negative,en,0

"We had just arrived in Las Vegas after being on a plane since the night before. We checked into our hotel and were starving so we went looking for someplace to eat. Always heard about the Serendipity's in New York, so we went to try out the one at Caesar's Palace.\n\nIt was busy, but the wait was only 20 minutes. Even though it was busy the service was good (fast & friendly). I ordered the Empire State Onion Rings for an app and the honey dijon chicken pizza for lunch. Yikes their servings were huge!! Both the rings and the pizza were excellent.\n\nUnfortunately I was so stuffed, that I could not try one of their signature drinks or desserts.

"""Sundown:The Vampire in Retreat"" is a rubbish.The acting is terrible,the atmosphere is non-existent and the characters are uninteresting.The only scary thing about this piece of scum is that majority of the IMDb users gave it a 10.This is really horrifying.No gore,no suspense,no violence,nothing.Bruce Cambell(""The Evil Dead"",""Intruder"")is completely wasted,the supporting cast is also terrible.Yes,some people may like this picture,especially a mainstream society but hard-core horror fans or gore-hounds won't enjoy this piece of crap.Personally I hate horror comedies,I prefer watching serious horror movies like ""Cannibal Holocaust"" or ""Last House on the Left"".In my opinion,a real horror movie is supposed to be scary,excessively bloody and disturbing,without stupid humour,which usually ruins the whole concept.This one isn't scary,isn't gory,isn't even funny as a comedy,so don't waste your precious time.",negative,en,0

"my husband and i are nearly professional hotel guests, as both of us travel a great amount of the year for both work and holidays. my relationship with the bel air is intense; it is beautiful and lush, and the 12 acres are totally unique in l.a., but contradictoraily there is an unacceptable amount of noise within the rooms that seriously interferes with peace and quiet...and the cardinal sin, sleep. they have never done a renovation that is not merely cosmetic, therefore, noise from adjacent rooms within each building block is HUGE. for example, in suite 155 and in charming 160, there are stairs to the upstairs rooms RIGHT BEHIND THE HEADBOARDS OF THE BEDS. yup. up and down, up and down, other guests going to either 252/254, or 261/264, not to mention housekeeping when the guests are out. in the bedroom of suite 133 i could hear the guest in the adjacent bedroom open and close drawers! in the living room of 138, i lept up thinking someone had come into our room when the guests in 136 came home (although the bedroom of 138 is recessed, and quiet). 226 is little and perfectly proportioned, but i had to slip notes under the doors of every room below me, as the opening and closing of their doors reverberated through the walls of my room. 157 is at the fartherst end of the property, and the bedroom has bad street noise from the stop sign at stone canyond road. i could go on and on. also, room service pushes trolly tables around the grounds on paved walk ways; the noise in the second bedroom of suite 150 was like someone shaking tamborines in the bed. we literally have a comment like this about EVERY room i have even been in....and that is most rooms at the hotel. we've been at this for nearly 5 years.
additionally, the locks on the doors are barbaric. i don't understand why they don't get soft closing doors and locks. it's idiotic. at the four seasons, they put a little 'bra' on the doors while housekeeping services the rooms so that when they are being opened and closed a lot, they are prevented from slamming. at the bel air, they just slam, for housekeeping, guests, room service, you name it. it's beyond me, totally.
it is an exasperating hotel. i keep going back because of the garden setting, which is so refreshing in a life of cities and travel. but i work hard and cautiously about room selection, and have no problem asking other guests to mind their doors, as i am most certainly devoted to being equally considerate of others.
in terms of service, i find the bell staff and valet parkers totally charming. i try not to rely on the front desk and concierge too much. they get the job done, but i find them awkward. once, when checking in with my in laws, the desk staff who escorted us said, 'would you like me to show you the smaller room first?"", as we had booked two classes of rooms! tacky, tacky. thre was a fantastic woman at the front desk, and she couldn't take it...she left for the post ranch inn in big sur. the operators are really sweet. the food is good, although a little too high end if you're there a while. i like to order english muffins and peanut butter and other homier snacks! i live on the tortilla soup, guac and chips, and cobb salad.
if you are interested in 148 or 146, ask first if there are events on the lawn, as those rooms overlook that popular area. middle of the week is safest, i would guess.
it is going to take a gang of us to influence to hotel to finally address the noise problem. please join me! i care about the hotel and don't want to have to go back to the peninsula, which feels like a concrete palace comapared to the bel air's wonderful setting (even though the service at the penn. is so fantastic---but my husband hates that bar, it's so scummy....but that'sanother entry!) i enter the grounds of the bel air feeling comforted by all the green, the divinesmell of the wood burning fireplaces, then i head to our room knowing i will have to battle with the noise. best wishes, a fellow traveler",negative,en,0

"Prix de Beauté was made on the cusp of the changeover from silence to sound, which came a little later in Europe than in Hollywood. Originally conceived as a silent, it was released with a dubbed soundtrack in France, with a French actress speaking Louise Brooks' lines, but was released as a silent in Italy and other parts of Europe. I was lucky enough to see the Cineteca di Bologna's flawless new restoration of an Italian silent print at the Tribeca Film Festival. I haven't seen the talkie version yet, but I think it's safe to assume the silent version is much more satisfying, since by all reports the dubbing is poorly done (Louise Brooks is clearly speaking English, so there's no way her lips could be matched.) Also, the film is made entirely in the silent style, with few titles and little need for dialogue. Prix de Beauté tells its story visually, with exciting, imaginative camera-work. The opening is instantly kinetic, with rapidly-cut scenes of urban life and swimmers splashing at a public beach. Throughout the film there is an emphasis on visual detail, on clothing, machinery, decoration, and symbolic images such as a caged bird, a heap of torn photographs, a diamond bracelet. This is silent film technique at its pinnacle.Louise Brooks, of course, is responsible for saving the film from obscurity. Seeing this makes it only more heartbreaking to reflect that this was her last starring role. Lustrously beautiful, she dominates the film with her charisma and also gives a perfectly natural yet highly charged performance. Her role here, more than in the Pabst films for which she's best known, is a woman we can fully understand and sympathize with. She plays Lucienne Garnier, a typist with a possessive fiancé, who yearns to get more out of life and secretly enters a beauty contest, with immediate success. She is then torn between the excitement of her glamorous new life and her love for the man who insists she give it all up or lose him. All of the characters are drawn with nuance. The fiancé inspires pity and is not merely a brute: he loves Lucienne, but is a limited man who can't cope with her having a life apart from him or attracting the attentions of other men. Even the ""other man"" in the story is not the simple slimeball we first take him for, though his intentions may be just as possessive as the fiancé's.*************************WARNING: SPOILERS BELOW***************** The film has many fine set pieces, including Lucienne's triumph in the ""Miss Europe"" contest, shown through the comic reactions of assorted audience members, who wind up pelting the heroine with flowers; her misery as a housewife, peeling potatoes while the pendulum of the cuckoo clock marks time behind her; a nightmarish trip to a fun-fair (in the silent version, this occurs late in the film, after her marriage) at which Lucienne, crushed among the low-lifes and depressed by her husband's macho antics, decides that she can't go on with her present existence; and especially the final scene in the projection room where she views her talkie screen test. Louise Brooks may never have looked more beautiful than she does here, with the projector's beam flickering on her alabaster profile, her shoulders swathed in white fur, her face incandescent under the black helmet of hair as she watches herself singing on screen. The double shot of her exquisite corpse and her still-living image on the screen is particularly poignant: Louise Brooks' image, like Lucienne's, remains immortal despite her frustratingly aborted film career.",positive,en,2

"As the smaller, yet newer sister property of the Wynn Empire, Encore was the culmination of 2 years and 2 billion dollars after the 1 year anniversary of Wynn Las Vegas. Sharing the same, luxurious theme as its neighbor, it may share a bridge and various restaurants and such, but rest assured the Encore is very much its own property.\n\nA recipient of the latest AAA 5 Diamond, it joins a very small handful of hotel establishments throughout Vegas. This basically means Encore has distinction of calling itself one of the most sophisticated, scintillating hotel properties in the world. An establishment that skimps on nothing less than decadent and showcases nothing but the finest. From its sleek exterior to its posh interior, there is no doubt this is a winner for Steve Wynn.\n\nWith 63 floors, the Encore is actually marginally taller than the Wynn and features a ton of space for casino, retail, hotel, and convention purposes. Like many of the casino resorts along the strip, there is almost plenty of options in every direction though at the Encore, there is less of a need to exit in the name of seeing, eating, and doing. They really do have it all.\n\nRoom accommodations are impressive from lowest standard two bed room to the ultra high end, massive suites for players. Wynn has invested so much to ensure the comfort levels in every room meet the high standards that most people have for this place. Personally, it comes down to the bed for me. I've never slept better.\n\nThe casino side isn't nearly as impressive as the Wynn. There seem to be some elements of Wynn Macau here, but on a whole the ambiance of gaming isn't for me anyways, a large selling point. Boutique casinos have a way of keeping the experience intimate for particular gamblers, but the feeling here is no different than like its Palazzo rival.\n\nOn the nightlife front, is there a better and more celebrated club than XS? For years, my favorite spot was La Bete, which later turned into Tryst ( <url> but now XS takes the cake. XS alone probably brings in more visitors than any club in Vegas and amongst the younger nightlife inspired crowd, is potentially the number one reason folks end up paying Encore a visit.\n\nFolks looking for a different eating experience will certainly find it at Sinatra ( <url> and the same goes for the clubby yet foodie ambiance of Andrea's ( <url> Wazuzu ( <url> is kind of like an overpriced Asian fusion diner, which is totally skippable in the Encore experience. I personally enjoy every meal at Society Cafe Encore ( <url> but that's just me. The line up of eateries may not be impressive compared to its casino counterparts, but at least the places featured are quality.\n\nLastly, I think Encore would be the ultimate property if famous Vegas performer Danny Gans were still alive today. When he was set to perform at Encore as his new home 4 years ago, he was also featured on what was at the time the largest freestanding marquee in the world. Garth Brooks is certainly no slouch, but Gans and his already bustling LV fame would've been the city's top featured act.\n\nWhile I don't think Encore lives up to the same standard as its bigger sister, it is still among the best on the strip for everything it offers. There is no losing scenario when it comes to staying here - it is still worth it for its location, name, and all that it has to offer.",neutral,en,1

"This movie is a fascinating drama about the Making of a movie. The Actor and the Actress really can't stand each other, but we build up to a scene in which they are to have sex - she for the first time, per script. The actress shows little emotion on or off camera in the plot, aside from she is freezing in the early scenes on a beach. The actor is self absorbed and increasingly defies the direction of the Director, Jeanne. I could not help being drawn in to the drama of 'how are these two possibly going to ACT their way thru a Sex Scene?' That drama in itself becomes more exciting than the actual nudity and foreplay performed for the cameras. Not that Roxane Mesquida isn't lovely and worth seeing naked! However, there is a pretty young stage hand who walks thru a few scenes as an extra. I think that is her in the far left edge of one of the pictures (2 of 9) here in IMDb. I don't even know if this girl is credited, but when she walks by (fully dressed of course) in confident indifference with her short blonde hair -- SHE is Sexy! WHO IS THIS GIRL???",positive,en,2

"I saw this film purely based on the fact that it was on the DPP Video Nasty list, and while I'm glad I saw it because it's now 'another Video Nasty down' - on its own merits, Andy Milligan's film really isn't worth bothering with. There are, of course, far worse films on the infamous list; but that doesn't make the pain of viewing this one any easier. The film was obviously shot on an extremely low budget, and that has translated into the script; as Blood Rites works on an idea often seen in horror cinema, and doesn't do anything new with it. Basically, the plot centres on three couples who find themselves at a house awaiting the results of a will. It's not long before they start getting picked off...blah blah blah. For most of the film, nothing happens; and then when we finally get down to the scenes that justify the movie being banned, they're so amateurish and silly that they're impossible to take seriously on any level. It's a very good thing that this movie doesn't have a very long running time as otherwise it could have been used as a particularly nasty method of torture. It all boils down to a fittingly tedious ending, which also succeeds in being a non-event of epic proportions. Apparently, this movie is still banned here in the UK; but somehow I doubt it's because of its shock value. Basically, Blood Rites isn't worth seeing and I personally can see no reason to recommend it. Unless, of course, you've made it your business to see everything on the Video Nasty list...",negative,en,0

"The Park Hyatt in Georgetown is truly a great hotel. From the moment we arrived the staff was extremely receptive and helpful. We stayed there on New Year's Eve as a treat for ourselves. When we checked in, they upgraded us to a Park Suite. The room was HUGE. You enter into a family room area with several modern sofa's desk sitting area. It had two large windows in the sitting room, with two addition windows in the bedroom, all of which you can open. From there you go into a bedroom with a gigantic bed and 42"" LCD TV.
The Bed was extrememly comforatble. I'm not sure if it one of those ""heavenly"" bed but it sure felt like it. Large down comforter with very soft sheets, and lots of pillows.
Next the bathroom........It was beutiful.....huge shower/tub area with two simultaneous showers, one that was on the ceiling and the other that was on the wall.......In addition the whole bathroom was a unique stone that felt like you were in buddist monestary......The bathroom even had a steam room that you could use......Of course there were soft slippers and huge bathrooms also available.......
In addition to the room itself, we did not go to the restuarant, but we did sample some drinks at the bar. A little on the pricey side, but definately worth it. The bartender was a young lady who made some great Martini's.

Though there is a sixty minute time limit, I have never been kicked out after an hour.

Roll (crab stick tempura, cream cheese, avocado, asparagus, topped with eel sauce) \nOf course I sampled my friend's dishes as well, and they were all delicious.

Unbelievable service from Carphone Warehouse. If anybody reading this is thinking ordering from them on line be warned. I have recently ordered some headphones (2 sets) On arrival over £300 of goods had been sent in a plastic bag. The bag had a split in it and only one set was delivered. On contacting their customer services team (who are based in South Africa) I have been given the complete run around. Firstly I was told that a replacement would be sent and it would arrive within 2 days. Didn't happen!!! I was then told an investigation would take place with their carrier(DPD) didnt happen!!! On my third call some 2 weeks later I was told the DPD driver was interviewed the day before and he confirmed successful delivery of the package and as far as they are concerned the matter is closed. I had to escalate to a manager (Fazel) who was supposed to call me back within 6 days. Still no response 9 days on. Tried ringing twice again today all I am being told their systems are down. In summary they have my money have failed to deliver the goods I have ordered and have therefore stolen from me. So before using Carphone Warehouse be warned they are quick to take your money but appalling when things go wrong. I have now had to make contact with Citizens Advice.

So I guess I'll never know what the writer was thinking! I still love this movie though and I recently watched it with my two year old niece. She loves it too although she insists on calling it ""Baby Water"" for reasons unknown to me. She loves the part where he jumps in the water and then declares ""I'm all clean."" (You have to understand that my niece is the cleanest 2 year old in the world!) We watched that scene over and over. I am so glad that we can enjoy this film together!

"My husband and I booked a room here for a weekend getaway. We always stay at Ink48 and this one just does not compare. For the same price, Ink48 is a much better value in every way. 70 Park feels old and dingy. The room was dirty with a lot of dust and fingerprints. Our air conditioning unit (there was no heat) separated from the wall when you touched it. The amount of dust behind there and in the unit made my stomach turn thinking of breathing that in. We requested a high floor and were given the second floor. Our view was a tree and a spotlight from the hotel shown through our window all night. The street noise was loud and we did not get much sleep even with earplugs. Not to mention, the walls between rooms are paper thin because we heard everything- and I mean everything-from the rooms next to us. Let's just say that if we had children in the room with us, we would have had to change rooms. The room service breakfast was okay. The staff was nice but service lacked the little details we are used to at Ink48. It was a good location but I would recommend you stay somewhere else and take a taxi. My husband and I will definitely not be staying at this hotel again.",negative,en,0

"There's a reason Paris rooms are generally priced much higher than other Harrah's properties (excepting Caesars). It's because Paris actually has redeeming qualities. Now, you won't find those qualities in the basic room, but, you will find them as soon as you get off the elevator.\n\nParis has some of the most fun clubs and restaurants. In particular, the dueling piano bar is a win on any given night. Good selection here, and fun crowds, but get there early. Also, Mon Ami Gabi, the strip-front French chain restaurant, is phenomenal, but that's for a different review. Another part of Paris' allure is that addicting crepe stand right outside the buffet. Mother of god.\n\nOtherwise, Paris is a bit crammed because of all the attention it gets with visitors to the fake Eiffel Tower. The casino does not have a very winning flavor to it, although we did comfortably sit and play roulette one night for a good three hours and still finished inners. But I think that was more chance than a standard.\n\nThe other gripe about Paris is how cramped the buffet is. It simply does not have that wide-open, spacious dining room like the others. It feels more like a mini, turnpike rest stop. The food is really good, but the price is way too high and it simply isn't comfortable to navigate.\n\nOverall, you're spending to stay here, and you're better off paying an additional $20-$30 a night to upgrade to a 4 or 5 star hotel with much better amenities.",negative,en,0

"My sister and I travel together and wanted to find a hotel in downtown Seattle close to the monorail (in Westlake Center about 2 blocks away) so we could visit the Space Needle and Chihuly Garden, close to Pike Place Market (about 6 blocks away) close to Nordstrom (2 blocks away) and close to the underground transportation center for a visit to Pioneer Square (again in Westlake Center about 2 blocks away). The Red Lion filled all of our desires!! Salvador Navarrete is the Director of Hotel Services and was at the front desk when we arrived. Salvador was very helpful and friendly and our room was ready for early arrival (yes -- we were lucky). The room was wonderful -- very clean and decorated very well. It was the perfect place to explore Seattle, go back to the hotel in the afternoon for a little rest and go back out again in the evening. We'll stay at the Red Lion whenever we're in Seattle.

"Went here for NYE dinner and the food was excellent, but the service was not up to par. There are many places in Las Vegas that offer excellent food and service. This isn't one of them, and I was so disappointed, because I had high expectations based on the experience I had at Michael Mina SF !\n\nService\nThe restaurant wasn't busy when we arrived at 5:30 pm. After we were seated and initially greeted by server#1, who stated that she would be serving us, things went downhill quickly. Ten minutes later, another server#2 approached us and asked if we had questions about the menu. After that, another server#3 dropped off fries. I never saw server#1 again. Another ten minutes waiting to order, I had to get up and go to the bar to request a server for our table. A different server promptly came over to take our order. I asked her if she was now our server, and she responded \""no\"", but she would take our order. I lost it at that point and demanded to know who our server is. She was very nice and offered to be our server and she promptly informed the manager about our experience. From that point on, service was 100% better, but I had to ask for it. The manager was very apologetic about our experience and adjusted our bill accordingly. Will I go back? Probably not. Again, there are many steakhouses in Las Vegas that offer excellent food AND service. For a $500 restaurant bill, I expected a lot more.",negative,en,0

"I've revisited this Menards countless times over the past few months. Lately, I've only been coming here when I absolutely must; I much prefer going to my local hardware store - their selection for anything that's not a big-ticket item is better, as is the service and overall experience. \n\n- There are signs posted in several places that claim, \""No waiting for savings! If there are more than 2 customers waiting to check-out, we'll open additional check-out lanes!\"" -- I have yet to see this happen. A most recent visit left us waiting in line for nearly 10 minutes before checking out.\n\n- The indoor/outdoor lumberyard is a source of frustration. I would venture a guess that one of the more commonly sought items from a hardware store like Menards is the basic 2x4 (or similar dimensional piece of lumber). Any idea where they're located? We wandered the indoor lumberyard for a good 5 minutes before realizing that the 2x4s are located in the faaaaaaaaaar back corner from the main entrance. You have to walk by scores of 1-by-whatevers, fence posts, fence slats, decorative posts, synthetic decking, lattice, and other rarely used items before you get to the 2-by-whatevers. Do you need pressure treated wood? That's outside, somewhere. Do you need cedar? That's on the opposite end of the indoor yard. Do you need plywood? It's at the front of the lumberyard. Do you need insulation? It's in the middle of the lumberyard... catch the problem? There's zero organization/logic...\n\n- The outdoor lumberyard. I hate (as do my contractor friends) checking in and out with the lumberyard guard. Put it all inside like every other store does and call it good.\n\n- Limited supply of plumbing items. I recently needed a Sharkbite connector for a plumbing project I was doing with PEX. Menards didn't have the fittings, but my tiny little local Ace Hardware did. A few days ago, I needed a John Guest fitting, which Menards didn't have, but my local Ace Hardware did. \n\n+ Holiday sales are usually a good deal, especially for large ticket items like ceiling fans and whatnot.",negative,en,0

"I still wonder why I watched this movie. Admittedly, before I viewed this film, I knew practicly nothing about the beatles. I didn't even know all their names! All I knew was that they had a ton of fans, they had some albums that some people claim to be the greatest ever, they broke up, John married Yoko Ono, and John was murdered.Also, VH1 isn't even my favorite music station, MTV is. Still, for some reason or another I decided to watch it, not expecting much. Surprisingly, I enjoyed it very much! The dialogue was written and handled very well with the occasion of a slight accent mess up. This is very important, because John and Paul talking is pretty much the whole film, allthough they are taken outside to explore more possibilities, and to keep you watching. Jared Harris and Adien Quinn give good performaces,overall.The ending was also very smart. I enjoyed how the movie gets you excited about the SNL performace, and then slaps you over the head and makes you realize that it would be better if they just let it go, and end it on a good note. My favorite moment is probably the touching rooftop scene.Overall, I recommend this film to almost everyone. It is a very good way of settling your curiosity of what could have happened if 6 years after the break up Paul just showed up on John's doorstep. Which is probably the main reason of my viewing this film, settling my curiosity on who the beatles really were and what could have happened to them after the breakup.",positive,en,2

"I rarely ever go on Yelp or write reviews, but this is the only business I've cared to write a 2nd review on. The manager Harun is awesome and always remembers me and my boyfriend, by name, and even what vehicles we have. We have been using their services for over a year now, and it is QUALITY work for very reasonable prices, well worth the drive from the South side of town where we live. They even have a board comparing their prices with the prices of other corporate businesses, so you can see the difference for yourself in prices. We are actually going to stop by today for my flat tire too, so I was checking the hours on this page and decided to say, THANK YOU Harun and Liberty Tech and Tire! :)",positive,en,2

"Visited this establishment based on high praise from yelpers and some friends of ours. It wasn't bad, but it was pretty mundane. My wife and I tried some of the more unusual, non-traditional offerings like [whatever it was called, their website is broken right now and I can't refer back to the menu. But it was an eccentric roll of some kind that had shellfish and other miscellany piled high on top] ranged from not very good at all to downright awful. Soggy sushi that you can't eat without a spoon is a very unappetizing thought\n\nBut the other, more orthodox sushi options were quite good, but no better than most other places I have been.\n\nI was lured in also by the advertisement that it is \""always happy hour\"", which was clever, but once you consider that \""if it is always happy hour, it never is\"" and then notice that all it really means is a section of items on their sushi menu priced maybe 50c to $1 less than average it isn't as impressive. \n\nI don't think this place is bad by any means, but I am perplexed as to why it has such high praise when I would describe it as average at best.",negative,en,0

It's not as good as Pizzeria Bianco, but Grimaldi's is just a mile and one phone call from being enjoyed in the comfort of my own home. Besides the awesome crust, I love the whole milk mozzarella.

"We had a one night stay in New York and selected this hotel based on the reviews, the price and the location. We arrived on a nice day and decided to walk from Penn Station. It is about a 15 minute walk which was not bad even with wheeled luggage. We arrived very early in the day after an overnight flight and the front desk clerk was able to place us in a room immediately which was very nice. The room was small but comfortaable. We did have a minor problem of ants in our room but they sent someone very quickly to spray the problem area. The bed in the room was a bit odd as it was just a foam mattress on top of a plywood board foundation. It was a bit odd but the bed was fairly comfortable. We found the hotel staff to all be very nice and friendly. An added bonus is that guests of the hotel receive a 10% discount at the Il Punto Restaurnat a block away. The restaurant had great food and great service.",neutral,en,1
"The last time I visited Nancy's Kitchen was when they were in their old premises. They always had long lines outside their restaurant then. Now, they have moved to a spanking new place. The hotel staff advised us to make a reservation a day in advance, and we did. It was a Saturday and we were there for dinner expecting a long line. Strangely, not only was there no queue but they had tables for walk ins as well. We ordered Pie Tee, Ngoh Hiang, Chilli Prawns, Tamarind Prawns and plain rice. The Pie Tee was all right but not terribly delicious. The filling was too wet and Pie Tee shells not exactly fresh and crispy. The Ngoh Hiang was soggy and simply unappealing. The Chilli Prawns were flavourful enough but there were only about 6 or 7 small prawns on the plate. The Tamarind Prawns tasted just like the name, prawns fried in tamarind sauce. Nothing spectacular. All the food especially the Ngoh Hiang tasted like they had been heated in the microwave. Even the sambal belachan which should accompany the food had to be paid for at RM3. The chillies were very coarsely pounded and the dish was more seeds than sambal. Perhaps it's because we didn't order the recommended dishes but I was really disappointed with this restaurant because it's supposedly one of the most famous in Malacca.",negative,en,0

"I really wanted to like this place. The reviews here are mostly good. I had the Tangerine Chicken. I realize that this probably isn't a great dish to review a Chinese place on, however this was rather disappointing. The atmosphere is comfortable and calm. [Most Chinese places I've been to are completely opposite of this] Also for a Saturday night they didn't have many people. [Saturday night is suppose to be a busy night]\n\nSome of the issues I found:\n1. The booths are quite old. If someone is sitting behind you it is very possible for them to push the booth into you. This is quite bothersome, and I had to move because of this reason. \n2. Price, it wasn't that bad. It was about $10 for an entree, nearly $2 for a drink and the meal ended up being $16-17 after tip.\n3. Service: I have no complaints. I'm not very picky on service, so I have no complaints.\n4. Value: For the quality, I wouldn't say the value is very high. They did give a lot of quantity.\n5. The food. This is the thing that bothered me the most. The Tangerine chicken was just chicken. There weren't any vegetables to compliment or to round out the plate. The chicken was chicken battered in tangerine peels, and their batter. Each ball of chicken was [with breading] about 2-3 inches in diameter. The chicken is covered in \""brown sauce.\"" The cirtus flavor was only if you had a taste of the fried remains of the tangerine peel. Also, this dish was claimed to be spicy, however from the looks of it, the only spicy element was entire chiles that had been added later to the sauce. \n\nHow could the food have been better. INAPC [I'm not a professional chief], but:\n1. Balance out the dish. Add less deep fried items to the dish. I had never gotten an typical Chinese restr. dish that was deep fried and didn't have some kind of vegetables. \n2. There was NO citrus flavor. If you want the flavor you're going to have to put it in the sauce. It is nearly impossible to favor via the meat via its breading. The chemical reaction completely kills most flavroids. \n3. Don't reuse the sauce. Create a spicy sauce and crush up those peppers. Just putting them in the sauce and heating it up at the last minute won't make it spicy. Add heat to the dish and stick by it. If it says spicy on the menu it should be intended to be spicy.",negative,en,0
"I've been here for two things: An overnight stay, and a wedding.\n\n1) The rooms are really lovely, much prettier than I ever would've expected. I'm always taken aback by hotel rooms that aren't decorated with those tacky shades of bright green, coral and tan. This had a pleasant ivory/gold and navy blue color scheme. The bed was very comfortable. Everything seemed very clean. The staff was friendly upon check-in/check-out. The only problem was that the walls were incredibly thin and we could hear everything that was being screamed down the hallways by drunks at 3 a.m. \n\n2) My friend's wedding reception that was held here was lovely. A member of the waitstaff noticed that a friend of mine had spilled her water all over the table and mopped it up before we could even ask for a towel. Most of the service was great like that, except for a mixup with some of the entrees--but that was corrected immediately upon our request.",neutral,en,1

"I like staying at Kimpton Hotels, for their coffee/wine service, robes, and free wifi. The location of the Monaco in downtown Seattle is great. I walked to Pike Place Public Market in 10 minutes with the sublime Sweet Iron waffle shop one block away. Also nearby is the swanky Purple Café and Wine Bar. The light rail is a short few blocks as well. First impressions were a mixed bag. We arrived around 2:00 p.m. and our room was not ready, so the women checking us in told us the bell boy would take our bags, but that didn't happen promptly. We must have stood around for 20 minutes and had to find the bell boy ourselves. Once our room was ready we got keys and access to the express elevator, which only services floors 10-11. The keys did not work on the first try so I had to get another set. Room 1017 was smaller than we expected and the bed a lot firmer, but still comfortable with nice views of downtown. There was an off musty smell in the room, as in the robes, which have seen better days. The bathroom amenities could be nicer. The wine hour was packed with nowhere to sit. Overall, an acceptable stay, but will look elsewhere for my next visit to Seattle.",positive,en,2

I would love to stay here again to take advantage of the pool and hot tub area. My only problem was the wireless internet. I appreciate that the hotel provides this for their guests, but it was way too slow. I tried to make a dinner reservation on the Opentable website, but I ended up calling the restaurant before the website even loaded on my laptop.",neutral,en,1

I finally had enough, slipped out in the hallway and found a night maid stripping beds and slamming the doors against the security bar to keep them from latching. A few other guests stuck there heads out and yelled as well. But the real clincher was the fire alarms going off one floor below most of the next night. The hotel security would then make announcements through the P.A. with a speaker in the room---scared the h*^% out of us at 0200. And 0300. And 0600.
The upside? It was cheap---like 70 bucks or something on Hotwire. And the staff are friendly, the beds very comfortable. But I'll probably go back to the Sheraton or Hilton at LAX. There comes a point where ""cheap"" only goes so far.....",negative,en,0

"I love, love, love the whole wheat pancakes that I can customize here!! It used to be that US Egg owned my heart with its patented oatmeal-blueberry-almond wheat pancakes until I tried Good Egg's blueberries and glazed pecans (double toppings, please!) pancakes made with whole-wheat batter, and a little whipped butter on the side, hold the syrup. If I feel like a little pain (food allergies) with my pancakes, I'd order them with special granola topping. It is quite tasty! However, it's heaven on earth for me with the blueberries and pecans.\n\nThe Isle of Capri omelette is delicious, as well. The capers, sundried tomatoes, and feta cheese give the egg-y delight a slightly, uh, for the lack of a better word, funky aroma, but it tastes so good! The side of country potatoes, while a bit salty, is equally yummy (can you guess which pieces I like best?). I hear the guacamole and bacon that come with many dishes are very good, too. I also recommend the reuben panini... oh my goodness! I just experienced multiple shudders up and down my spine... bet you didn't know women could have those! LOL. Speaking of orgasm-inducing foods, has anyone else had a Smokey Forest sandwich at Duck and Decanter??\n\nBTW, I tried ordering the pancakes here ala US Egg, with oatmeal and almond toppings, but they weren't the same. I prefer US Egg's version; however, I'm a sucker for those loyal customer punch cards, and, on certain days, Good Egg even offers double punches! Suh-weet!\n\nP.S. I've tried four locations [Thomas/Central, Ray/Rural, Dobson/S of 60, and McDonald/Scottsdale Rd (?)] and I prefer those on Thomas and Dobson when it comes to good to great service. The servers there really shine on customer service and the few complaints my party and I had to give were met with sympathetic ears and satisfactory amendments by both servers and management (local and headquarters). I wish I could say the same for those on Ray and McDonald.\n\n---UPDATE!---\nYou ever hear of those who like cold pizza? Well, I never was one of those people. I've tried it a couple of times, but I just don't get it [and I refuse to try it again, 'cause frankly, it's a waste of a good pizza... I'd rather resurrect it again to it's former (but not quite) glory by popping it in the toaster oven]. I have, however, found that I LIKE cold blueberry and glazed pecan whole wheat pancakes out of the fridge! And guess what? They're so good, they don't even need butter! Hmm... it's a texture-lover's dream... cakey, and those sweet, almost preserve-like blueberries- some macerated, others still whole- and then those crunchy pecan bits!",neutral,en,1

Now, I'm not competition eater, but he couldn't have possibly made any money off me, seriously. I ate about five $10 rolls, my favorite being, \""I need water\"", which was spicy but not too spicy.

"I wrote this in my blog on May 4 2007 - this is part 1, part 2 is in my review of Burn nightclub. Just to clarify, I'm not a gay hater or phobic or whatever in any way. This was written tongue-in-cheek. I've actually been to BS West quite a few times - my feelings about it are that it's kinda lame for a gay scene. I've seen better. It's a decent little bar though in its own right. Anyway - here's my blog as it appeared:\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nSo last weekend was apparently 'Gay Weekend' - it was purely unintentional though. Accidental gayness to be sure.\n \nI was hanging out on Friday with my straight lesbian friend (she insists she's straight and that her girlfriend is as well - either way it gives me 'the hot,' so I don't question it) trying to show her around the cool parts of town so she doesn't decide to move pack it up and move away. She lives in the worst and most isolated ghetto in the valley. After moving here from a much cooler city and state, she's ready to get the fuck out of here after less than a year. I can't really blame her.\n \nAnyway - we were in downtown Scottsdale walking around and we had parked in a parking garage that was next to this tucked away gay bar called BS West. I asked her if she wanted to go there since it was 'her people' and she did, so we did. The first person we saw was a crossdresser (I'll get to that in a bit), and when we walked in - she made a beeline for the bathroom. I followed and hung out near the door with my back facing the wall - trying to act casual while avoiding surprise anal rape attack.\n \nShe 'came out' and we got ourselves a drink and found a quiet observer spot outside so we could spy on the gays in their natural habitat. It was mostly dudes in this place - almost no lesbians. The guys at this place ranged from nearly middle-aged guys in hawaiian shirts, shorts and sandals to skinny young emo pretty boys. \n \nThe drinks were pretty stiff, but the atmosphere was dead, so we headed out after one drink. We accidently opened the door to a freezer or storage room instead of finding the exit... I think we were both concentrating on not getting surprise attack analy raped. The rest of the night went on without incident. At one point we were invited to this club called Burn in Phoenix by this girl who showed me where BS West was in the first place when I tagged along with her and the fags to her hag. We respectfully declined, but made a mental note of the fact that we were 'missing out' on all the hot sexy single ladies.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nNew content: \n\nWith regard to the mention of that first visit to BS West - it was pretty amusing actually... this was ages ago... but the first time I had met with my friend's gay pals was this night - my first visit to BS West - and we got out of the car and started towards BS West. I thought we were headed to Loco Patron where I had previously had a horrible experience and I said \""oh, fuck this - I'm not going here!\"" and got all viciously adamant about it.\n\nMy friend's gay friends went through a spectrum of emotion ranging from confusion, curiosity, intolerance, and disgust. They thought I didn't want to go to BS West because it was a gay bar and that I was a horrible asshole. Once near the door and inside, I realized my mistake and spent the next half hour feeling like a shit heel and saying my sorries. I don't think I ever fully recovered from that first impression, but I'm friends with one of those guys now at least.",negative,en,0

"I have to preface with the fact that I'm not a huge fan of Italian food.\n\nI was unimpressed with the customer service: the server was apparently not typically on the floor as she was the bartender. My first question is \""Why?\"" She got our order incorrect (which actually ended up being a good thing) but was a bit slow. I usually like all salads but I did NOT like the chopped salad. For some reason, the acidity was too high and some of the flavors did not bode well together. \n\nMy friends raved about the Nutella pie: it was good but it was much more like a Cheesecake Factory cheesecake slice than a pie: huge and don't order more than one per table--too much. For dinner, we ordered the Pollo Bianco and since we both wanted it, we decided for family style. The family style doesn't come with side dishes so you have to order those separately--so we did. But then they brought the single serving and still brought the sides--and the single serving is served on top of mashed potatoes: one of the sides we ordered. Enter double sides of mashed potatoes. I will say the sauce of the chicken was good, but the mashed potatoes were the same as anywhere else. \n\nI guess it's just another standard chain restaurant. Too bad. It could have been so much more.",negative,en,0

"Another place so overrated that I wonder what kind of taste people must have to rate these so highly.

I'll help you, this place is bad. \n\nThe service is so poor I don't know how I didn't eat my paper napkin. It was so slow that I almost walked out. \n\nThe food is what you'd cook at home if you weren't lazy, but you are so you come here. And pay a hefty price for your laziness. Guilty as charged. \n\nExcept your food is better because you get it when you want it, not when they remember to put your order in. The waitress didn't write my order down (next time I'm insisting!) and it came out crazy late and without something I'd added. Grrr.\n\nBy the time I'd finished eating I knew that I'd never be back.

"We had stayed at this hotel years ago before it was redone by Starwood. The new modern decor doesn't match the charm of this old building. The hallways are dark and do not have the feel of a high end hotel. The rooms are small with no exterior light coming in.

"My company set me up at this centrally located hotel. The location is the only thing I can recommend about this property. The lobby is not welcoming and seems dark and dank in my opinion. It needs light and air freshening. When I arrived they told me I was ""upgraded"" - too bad that meant a room in the basement. Do not agree to a room on the ""first"" floor. It is in the basement with windows by the ceilings. To get there you take a slow and small elevator to a dark hallway with whirring appliances in the hall outlets. Guessing they are mechanisms to get rid of the moisture causing the damp feeling and damp smell. The room was dark and small - how was this an upgrade? The bed was fine for the night and the bathroom was good sized and clean. But I would not stay here again - for more than $400 a night I thought it was a tired and unappealing place. I just love the Willard and would definitely recommend that in the stead of this place.",negative,en,0
"I've eaten here many times since it opened up a couple years ago. When we want to eat out and can't decide where to go we usually end up coming here since it has decent food, a diverse menu and is kid-friendly. Here's a rundown of some of the things I've tried:\n\n- Mini duck tacos: good\n- Hummus: good, but nothing special\n- Thin crust pizzas: I love the Dorthea Sundried tomato pizza, it's probably one of my favorite items; Brie cheese pizza is also very good. Pass on the kobe beef pizza... blah\n- Woodfired pizzas: most are solid choices, but not spectacular. The ones I would get again are the Hawaiian, the Thai chicken, garlic chicken, BBQ chicken, or goat cheese.\n- Fettuccine alfredo: ehh... pass\n- kobe beef burger: not worth it, if you want a burger go someplace else\n- grilled shrimp salad: tastes great, the larger order is big enough for 2 people\n- risotto: no longer on the menu, which is a good thing because I didn't like it\n\nSo, if you come here get a pizza or a salad. Those are your best bets. If you have kids they'll probably find something on the menu that they'll like. The service is usually good, although during peak dining hours expect a wait to get your food.",negative,en,0

"The spread was relatively wide. There were so many different cuisines and spreads - Japanese, Chinese, Indian, International/Western, Bread/Pastries, Cheese, Yoghurt, Ice Cream. I love the intimate setting. While other larger hotels may have an even wider spread, the quality of food could not compare with this, and boy, there were the insane crowds that makes you feel kind of stressed out in the morning. The highlights of the buffet breakfast meal I had would have to be the roast beef. It was tender and so very juicy. The accompanying sauce was a worthy companion as well. I also particularly enjoyed the spanish omelette, which went really well with the seafood curry (that had a generous serving of prawns). The sautéed mushrooms were excellent; really tasty. The indian breads (various types of prata) were so-so, which didnt really come across as freshly made. But the vegetable curries were brilliant. And it went down so very well with the exceptional idli; I have never tasted one so good before! The putu mayam was excellent as it was paired with really good quality shredded coconut and brown sugar. The freshly made smoothies were exceptional and ran out rather quickly! The yoghurt/soft serve machine provided amazing treats. The yogurt was tastefully sour and very natural. The homemade muesli mix was also brilliant, though they could have been stored at an even lower temperature to provide a more wonderful treat. Unfortunately I did not have any stomach space left to try the chinese tim sum and sushis. I thoroughly enjoyed the meal, hope to come back again (even though it is on the pricey side). But hey, it was matched with excellent quality food and service!",positive,en,2

"There's really no way to beat around the bush in saying this, Lady Death: The Motion Picture just plain sucks. Aside from the fact that the main character is a well endowed blonde running around Hell in a leather bikini with occasional spurts of graphic violence, the movie seems to have been made with the mentality of a 1980's cartoon based on a line of action figures. The bad guy himself even talks like a Skeletor wannabe, has the obligatory inept henchman, and lives in a lair that looks to have been patterned after the domain of the villain from the old Saturday morning Blackstar cartoon. Just don't expect any humor other than the sometimes howlingly bad dialogue. At other times it feels like the kind of anime tale better suited to hentai, yet there is no sex, no tentacle rape (Thank goodness!) and very little sex appeal, this despite the physical appearance of the title character. There is simply no adult edge to this material, unless you count the half-naked heroine and bloody deaths. Essentially, what we have here is a feature length episode of She-Ra, Princess of Power, but with skimpier clothes and more gore.",negative,en,0
"***PLEASE READ BEFORE BOOKING***
I'm going to simply give you TEN reasons why you shouldn't stay here...
1. Firstly, the receptionist was rude and retarded. There was no greeting. It was a case of ""What do you want?"" Rather than ""Hi how are you? How can I help you?
2. The first room we had (which was across the street!) - the bed was not made and it was dirty from the last visitor. How could this have possibly happened? We then went back to the receptionist (which is a 5 minute walk across the street) who gave us a key to a different room. There was no apology.
3. When we got the key to our ""clean"" room, it was still disgusting. The bed sheets stunk, the shower was awful and the curtains were yellow through age. The carpets were grimy. The room had definitely NOT been re-inervated in 2008 as stated on their website. It was something from the 1800s.
4. The ""free"" WIFI connection was shocking. It barely worked.
5. I had to pay a $175 deposit just incase we damaged the room which I don't know if we have got it back yet. There was nothing in that room worth $10 never mind $175!!!
6. The website says breakfast included. This is not true. You get a coffee and a Danish.
7. There was no air-con or cooling system. I asked for a fan at reception, she gave me a heater. She also directed me to an electrical store where Harisson meets 8th street, which by the way, does not exist.
8. When we asked for a fan, another guest came down to reception to return their broken fan. After they left, the receptionist asked us if we wanted this fan? Oh cmon!!
9. We were charged twice for our stay. Seriously, how can that happen? (Retarded reception staff). We now need to spend money contacting them to try to get a refund.
10. It's a *&@£ hole. Why would you spend more on a hole when you can stay in a clean but simple environment like motel 6?

"We booked the room in January 2008 for a stay in July 08. There are four of us. We booked a room with two double beds. We get there and everyone on line to check in was mad. The hotel staff kept apologizing to people. I knew I was in for something. They apparently booked all of the double bed rooms for some cheerleading competition that was going on at their hotel. Because they have a contract with them, they had to bump everyone even though we booked it in January. They told me they could give us a room with one king size bed and send up a cot. We are four adults! Three of us had to squeeze on one bed?? Not going to happen. So one of us slept on the cot, another on a chair and ottoman. They couldn't give us another cot because it was a fire hazard. They also explained to me that the hotel does not guarantee a bed type, the only guarantee a room type. I never heard of that before.
Then, when we got to the room and there were no towels at all! Luckily, I was nosey and opened up the doors to a cabinet in the middle of the hallway and saw a bunch of towels. so we took them from there.
Then the thick curtain that keeps the sun out was missing! Luckily we were on the side of the building that the sun sets on. They ended up comping us that entire night but still, that was wrong. They only comped us for the night AFTER we called to complain about the curtain.",negative,en,0

"This hotel has incredible history and beautiful architecture but once you've seen all the magnificant common rooms (lobby, ballroom, Palm Court, old style elevators) it isn't any different than any other overpriced, 4 star historical hotel.
Our friends were getting married in the ballroom so we thought that we would take this opportunity to stay at The Drake since I'm pregnant and it would be an easy escape for me to my room in the wee hours. Check in was at 3:00 and we were there on time as the wedding trolley was leaving at 5:30 and we needed time to get ready. At check in we were offered a deluxe upgrade on our king room but the hitch was that it wouldn't be ready for over an hour. Talk about dangling the carrot and yanking it away! We couldn't wait an hour and considering check in wasn't until 3:00 I can't imagine why the room wasn't ready.
We settled for our existing king reservation (at $250) and found the room to be fine but of course our view was of the air conditioning units and we were next door to the Fitness area. So much for wedding party group booking bonus! I can't imagine how much money our friends spent for their wedding at The Drake but I'm sure they would have been mortified to hear about the rooms that their guests were given especially since they were ""promised"" that everyone under the group booking would be nicely taken care of.
Pro's - decor was decent, slightly dated but clean. room was decent size, noise between rooms/floors was negligible. Bathroom was ok in size but only suitable for one person at a time. Con's - heating system was horribly loud, had to turn it off at night to sleep, no exhaust fan in bathroom, wireless access was not free, bottled water was $7.00 for a small bottle, split of wine was over $25, breakfast was over $25 per person with another 20% markup for room service. There was coffee in the room but I wasn't sure if it was free and the room service menu said it was $15 so we popped over to Starbucks instead. Parking was ok at $39 a night if you use the public parking lot two doors down - you can even charge it to your room tab.
We ended arriving a day early and didn't have a room booked. On Hotwire we found a 3 star hotel for $63 a night in the magnificant mile area. We weren't getting in until 11:00 p.m. so we weren't that picky. The hotel ended up being the Holiday Inn Express. Of course for $63 our room overlooked the air conditioning units here as well but we had a very comfortable king bed, huge plasma tv, wonderfully decorated room, free breakfast, free wireless and a great location. The room was super small - basically just enough room for the king bed and a really small bathroom but for the money it was so much more worth it than The Drake. The building was beautiful, location was great, personnel were very friendly, self parking was around the corner. Ok, there's no ballroom, no Palm Court and Queen Elizabeth didn't stay here but does that really matter??? Save your money, skip The Drake, walk through it if you want to check it out, but there are plenty of beautiful hotels in the magnificant mile area for alot less money!",negative,en,0

"It's pretty much your standard Walgreens. However, I think it deserves 4 stars because they carry what I need, and their pharmacy services is very efficient.\n\nThey carry the things I usually buy at a Walgreens, cough medicine, candy, aspirin, greeting cards, etc. It's in a convenient location, since I use Stephanie & Horizon Ridge Pkwy a lot. \n\nWhenever I fill my prescription, it's always ready when promised. My last visit, they informed me that they were only able to fill a partial of my son's cough suppressant, and that they'll be getting more in. I was impressed that they contacted me promptly when they did. Fortunately, I had enough cough syrup to last me through my son's flu. I thought that was good and efficient on their part, nonetheless. Hopefully I won't be needing it anytime soon again, but I guess I'll have it ready. \n\nThanks for the good service!",neutral,en,1

"I flew two routes with Citilink, Jakarta to Padang and Kualanamu to Jakarta in early October and was greatly pleased with the overall experience. The aircraft were in good condition, clean and airy, the flight attendants attentive, kind and professional in their demeanor. Most importantly the product gave the impression of well practiced routine and safety not an unimportant impression for nervous fliers. We were on time on both flights. The for purchase entrees were laughably cheap and in fact more than satisfactory ie. enak sekali! As an aside, their website proved to be the easiest one to navigate of the various Indonesian airlines, permitting trouble free purchase with a US based credit card. The fares were very competitive in fact in most of the routes I comparison shopped Citilink was the cheapest. But it certainly was not the cheapest in terms of product and experience. I do not see much difference with Garuda in terms of the quality, condition and state of the aircraft. Of course Garuda does provide snacks and meals included in the price of fare. I rank Citilink slightly above par with AirAsia and certainly much better than Lion Air. The only drawback vis-a-vis competitor airlines is that the Citilink route network is substantially smaller than Garuda or Lion, flying primarily between Jawa and Sumatera. Hopefully they can add flights to destinations in the Eastern part of the archipelago to give Garuda and Lion a run for their money. Very pleased and satisfied customer!",positive,en,2

"I'm a fan when it comes down to great music in an awesome atmosphere. Of course, Vegas always has something to offer in a lil' city. Great minds think alike when the words of: pool party, vegas, house music, and a combo of inebriated drunkards basking in the sun while sipping on endless amount of booze come into play!\n\nMarquee is deemed to be THE spot to pool party. However, I think Encore and WET Republic take the cake. Here are my gripes:\n\nSmall pool to splash around and sparse accommodations to any of your belongings, yet alone, leave it with a large pile of other people's belongings. Hence, bottle service gives you a small space to party like a rockstar with your friends and soon-to-be friends and leave your stuff hanging around. The service is baffling!! My friend orders us bottle service and pitchers of more alcohol to go around with our group, but to our own dismay, the little monster shuffling her small frame and fake boobs in our faces was utterly rude! She wanted us to pay first before we got our drinks?! WOW!! My friend paid for everything, called his credit card company to cancel the transaction, voila!, we got our FREE booze in hand!! Boo-yah!\n\nThe crowd was so-so. I've seen better eye candy at Encore and WR. A group of guys tried their best to fondle me and my girlfriends thinking I wouldn't say one word. I NEVER take that kind of advantage from ANYBODY! Security was shamefully nonchalant about the incident and scurried off thinking it was no big deal. Really?! After much avoidance and drinking plenty of vodka shots and AMFs, I was dancing like nuts to the filtering sounds of house music!\n\nI really want to give this place more than what it should be credited for but I find it disappointing when I receive lack of service from anybody. I enjoyed the hours of incredible music, my awesome set of company, and what was little to be known, an okay venue. Is it worth it to come back again? Depends.

Always busy, forget going out with a group on a weekend night unless you want to wait an hour and a half.\n\nYes, the curds are good, but I've had better (try the Rigby). The best thing is the sauces that come with the curds (you have your choice of 4, all of which are pretty good). You can also get the sauces with the shoestring onions, which I probably prefer to the curds. The lazy susans are fun and different, and in my opinion the most exciting thing that this place has to offer. \n\nI may be biased because I am not a meat eater, and therefore the Old Fashioned menu does not have much to offer, but I've talked to many other friends who agree that its reputation is overblown for what it is. If you want to have a casual lunch at a Wisco style pub for lunch during the week, the OF has decent salads and sandwiches. But with so many far better restaurants, gastropubs and bars in Madison, I can't imagine why you'd choose waiting in a cramped space at the OF just for the sake of the curds.

"Stayed for 6 nights Between Christmas & New Yr 2011/ 12. Our family room was in the newer part of the hotel which had wider corridors, bigger lift and nicer decor than the older part.
Room was clean and a good size with TV, hairdryer, fridge and expected complimentary toiletries.
We had breakfast each morning just down from the hotel across the street at the City Lights Diner. Food very good, cheap and service very friendly and efficient.
Hotel service was good, we had a pizza one night in the hotel restaurant but service was shoddy and it wasn't cheap. Go to a local diner they are much better!
The deli across the rd do excellent tasty sandwiches and coffees to take back to your room.
Pool was busy but a bonus to pass an hour or so in the evening.
We went everywhere on either foot or subway, no taxi needed! Fantastic location! Book Empire State, Statue of Liberty online and with fast track before you go - cheaper and no massive long queuing times! Saw The Lion King - booked this beforehand - expensive but worth it! The site of the twin towers is free but you book a time slot at a local booth.

"I popped in here around 11:30 am and got some food to go. I always walked past this place and would tell myself I would try it, but only got around to it today. \n\nThey focus on local and organically grown ingredients. \n\nThe atmosphere is nice. Very calm, comfortable, clean, minimalistic, but still warm (lots of natural light, wood, and splashes of green and orange). \n\nThe service was very good. Friendly and fast. \n\nHowever, I will add the following note: Their kitchen is not a typical \""restaurant\"" kitchen. Imagine a refreshingly simple, but nice, home kitchen with a large center island. Now, place an unobtrusive cash register at one end of the island. This is pretty much what you will see when you walk through the front door. So, I'm not sure how things get when they are busy. \n\nI got their daily special, which happened to be ribs, green beans, potato salad, and a parsley (I think) & vinegar dipping sauce. They had a plate of it displayed on a table when I walked in. I'm not sure if that is what they usually do with their daily specials, but if it is, the marketing strategy worked on me. \n\nThere was a generous serving (6 pieces) of ribs. They were pork, I believe, and had a great dry rub that was on the savory side (not sweet). If you have a preference for ribs drenched in sticky, sweet, BBQ sauce, then these ribs were not meant for you. The potatoes were cooked until tender. They had a great creamy texture to them as you ate them, but they were not mushy. The sauce was a sour cream based sauce, I believe, rather than a mayonnaise base, and also tasted very good...although perhaps just slightly under seasoned. The green beans were cooked perfectly with a nice crunch to them. I'm not sure if they were blanched first, but they were nicely browned in the pan with a mild but flavorful garlic and oil dressing. \n\nThe entire meal was only $10 before taxes and tip. A very reasonable price for the quality and quantity of food you get. \n\nAll-in-all, I am a fan and I will definitely be back again.",neutral,en,1

"I've stayed at many hotels and, even when there were glitches, I've always enjoyed my stay. This is the first time that I can say that my stay was a 5 day long marathon of frustrating events. I stayed at the hotel because it was one of the designated hotels for a conference that I attended. Throughout my stay, I encountered hotel staff members that appeared to be poorly informed and poorly trained. I was amazed that only a minority of the staff demonstrated any professionalism or concern for customer service. The first night of my stay, at 11:00 PM, I was awakened by knocking and an attempt to open my hotel door. On the other side of the door was a hotel staff member who insisted that I had checked out and should vacate my room. I told her that I had just checked in for a 5 night stay but she was adamant that I was wrong and asked that I call the front desk. When I did so, I was told that I was indeed checked in but did not get any apology for the incident. The day of my check out, housekeeping knocked on the door multiple times starting at 8:30 AM even though I had made arrangements for a 2 PM check out. Some of the additional issues that I encountered during my stay included peeling paint in the room, an unbelievable charge of $7.95 per 15 minutes for access to a hotel computer, a door that was very difficult to open and would be a hazard in case of an emergency, lack of amenities that are taken for granted even in value hotels such as replacement of plastic cups, soap, an extremely small bathroom with inoperable heating dials and a blow dryer that was ancient and barely operational, a twenty minute delay in getting a replacement hair dryer after the original dryer stopped working, and a front desk staff member who had difficulty understanding my concerns as well as those of a gentleman that followed me due to a significant language problem. I had to wait 25 minutes for another staff member in order to have a refund credited to my bill. When I shared my frustrations with a staff member, I was encouraged to discuss my concerns with the front desk manager as that would be the only way that positive changes would occur. I shared my concerns with a hotel manager who asked for my email address so that management would be able to contact me. I never heard from anyone. I left the Boston Park Plaza Hotel with a bill for over $1400 and the certainty that I had been totally ripped off. Stay away!",negative,en,0

"This place sucks.
Don't get me wrong, it's a beautiful hotel. The rooms are amazing and EVERYTHING was new when I stayed.
However what sucked were:
1. The service - The staff were arrogant and obnoxious little weasels! Never judge a book by it's cover, I was on a work/leisure trip however I had just flown from Australia to NYC. Now that's a 22-24 hours trip with an approx 15-16 hour straight flight. So by the time, I had to do the L.A to NYC leg, I was delirious, tired and needed a shower.
Now, I was dressed comfortably and casually. Already I was getting looks from the staff.
They didn't open my taxi door (which I don't mind) however why were they doing it for everyone else?
I turned up at the reception to check in and was left standing there for seriously a few minutes while the girls and guys were talking about their plans for the weekend and other useless crap!
Finally the receptionist asks, 'Do you understand the current rates we charge for this hotel?'
By this stage, I was fuming. But I kept my mouth shut.
Everything changed once she realised which room that was booked and what type of credit card I had and where I worked. This type of crap pisses me off!
Management cannot change this behaviour, however the one thing I believe in is hire staff for attitude especially the face of the business because you can teach any monkey skills.
The staff at The Standard need to shape up as the benefits of being the 'cool' and 'new' place to be will only be appealing for so long.
2. Their internet is terrible. I had to send through documents from a local internet cafe due to their slow service.
3. The location is okay, unless you enjoy hanging around over-weight Russian gangsters with beautiful blonde young girlfriends, then this is the place to be.
Overall, the experience was okay. I enjoyed waking up and seeing the Hudson River every morning. And I did enjoy that the hotel was pretty brand new when I stayed. However on my recent trip to NYC, I stayed at the Rivington in LES.

It was beyond stupid and un-realistic, Casey Affleck delivered a reasonable performance, Graham's recent roles have been lack-luster and this is not an improvement.Graham's most recent role was Blessed which I also found misleading and didn't appeal to me at all.Pros AffleckCons Predictable, Unrealistic, Poor Acting and not a comedy movie!",negative,en,0

I came here recently for a few business casual outfits after discovering this was the last standing J.Crew shop in Vegas and fell in love with the mall. Ive always been an avid Fashion Show girl, but this def comes in a close second. I couldnt believe how cheap everything is. I will no longer be paying $300 for a pair of Joes Jeans hooray!

"Greatly enjoyed this 1945 mystery thriller film about a young woman, Nina Foch,(Julia Ross) who is out of work and has fallen behind in her rent and is desperate to find work. Julia reads an ad in the local London newspaper looking for a secretary and rushes out to try and obtain this position. Julia obtains the position and is hired by a Mrs. Hughes, (Dame May Witty) who requires that she lives with her employer in her home and wants her to have no involvement with men friends and Julia tells them she has no family and is free to devote her entire time to this job. George Macready, (Ralph Hughes) is the son of Mrs. Hughes and has some very strange desires for playing around with knives. This was a low budget film and most of the scenes were close ups in order to avoid the expense of a background and costs for scenery. This strange family all live in a huge mansion off the Cornwall Coast of England and there is secret doors and plenty of suspense.",positive,en,2

"So you drive into the parking lot of a random strip mall and see a restaurant with \""Bistro\"" in the name. Based on my personal experience, that normally would mean that the restaurant would need to be avoided.\n\nBut that generalization certainly does not apply to this place. \n\nThis establishment is one of those rare gems where you can achieve three- to four-star restaurant quality flavors at a one- to two-star price.\n\nWe came with a large party of 9 for lunch, and everyone was satisfied with their choices. My personal favorites were the couscous salad, which featured perfectly seared and seasoned ahi tuna as well as a perfect level of acidity in the couscous, and the Jamaican curry chicken, which had the right amount of spice countered with a seemingly endless variety of greens. Certainly, fresh ingredients are clearly the focus at DW's.\n\nNot many folks would expect such quality for entree prices identical to those at Applebee's.\n\nDrinks are also tasty and generous in terms of their alcohol/cost ratios.\n\nThe atmosphere is hip but very informal and relaxed. Servers are cordial, attentive, and have a keen sense of humor.\n\nIf you are visiting Las Vegas and have a car, do not hesitate to drop by this restaurant if you need a break from that casino prime rib or buffet special.",positive,en,2
"Yeah, hotel rates in NYC are a rip off. And, yeah, hotes, on average, suck there. You'll normally end up paying a lot and getting too little in return, when it's not simply the case that the only thing you get is a ginormous headache...
This hotel, although still charging a ""royal"" price however not offering a ""kingly"" service, is actually a fair business.
Clean, organized, and with a helpful, friendly staff.
Re location, in spite of not being with the head sticked in Times Square (so, if you do the maniac-tourist-in-NYC style, go look for an overlriced piece of junk around 42nd and 7th Av), the place stays in a right, easily walkable distance from the Big Aaple anthill, about 3 blocks from the subway station (Lines 4/5/6, which take you pretty much anywhere). The proximity with Park and Mafison, let alone Lexington itself, is also pleasant. Central Park, Rockfeller Center, etc., arejust around the cornet.
There's a charming pub at the lobby, for drinks and snacks.
If you are a breakfast-addicted, remember to purchase that meal in advance or while checking in (it's not ordinarily included in the rate). In any event, there's a nice, typical, American diner on 50th btw Lexington and Madison.",positive,en,2

How did Alice Krige (whom I do adore) get a hour to herself?\n* Some panelists were kinda eh... I don't really understand how a extra in a part gets to be a panelist\n* They need more night events for the general audience. They usually throw events for those who got the Captain's Chair or Gold Ticket and as much as I would want a Captain's Chair or Gold Ticket - it's always either: overpriced, you can't just buy certain days, or sold out. \n* The primary costume contest judges were not Trekkies/Trekkers. They were fashion/costume designers. I feel like they need to get some Trek costume designers to do the judging. \n\nMy Advice to you guys if you plan on going to a Trek convention and I plan on going back!:\n* Dress up - it's fun and you won't be the only one!\n* Map out the schedule and determine the best days for you!\n* Go reserve your seat (if you have general tickets) early if you really want to take good photos)\n* BUY YOUR AUTOGRAPH/PHOTOGRAPHS EARLY. Buy it online from the website because it can be sold out if you really want their photo. Last year, Sir Patrick Stewart sold out but I have one planned out for another Trek convention - I already bought it and it's FIVE months from now. Also Shatner sold out but I was fortunate to get one with him!\n* When you go up to ask questions to the cast/crew people... MAKE SURE IT'S NOT A TYPICAL QUESTION... they are so used to the \""what's your favorite episode\"" and such. Also, please keep up with what they are doing now or else you will end up saying something that is known. \n*If you have a complicated costume, STAY at the Rio - trust me.\n* Always ASK before taking a photo of someone, EVERYONE there is super nice and will let you take a photo of them!\n\nWould I go back:\nYes. I love the people I met. I loved being able to meet the celebrities that made up Star Trek! \nI had more fun at the 2011 convention because we broke the world record for trek costumes and plus, Picard was there. It was also Leonard Nimoy's second to last appearance. \nBut this year was great with the Four other captains - Bakula, Brooks, Mulgrew and Shatner!\nSo ...

FUE-LPA: Booked this as a part of a TUI holiday package. They booked me on FUE-LPA with Binter and then on their own airline TUIfly from LPA to MUC. I tried to check in at the Binter Counter in FUE the day before. Staff reasonably friendly and efficient but not a lot of English skills. They checked me through to TUIfly to MUC. Flight was delayed for around 35 minutes. No announcement about delay was made. When the late aircraft arrived they made people board as fast as possible. Flight was on an ATR which seemed well maintained and had comfortable leather seats. Catering water and chocolate bar fine for this short hop.

"We stayed at the Holiday Inn Chicago - Plaza Mart February 18 - 20. This hotel is in the perfect location and it has amazing views. Per other trip advisor posts I requested a higher floor and a room with a view. For $109.00 per night (including parking) we had a room overlooking downtown Chicago from where the canals all meet. It wasn't a lake view but it was still amazing!
The hotel starts on the 15th floor of the Chicago Sun Times building. It is connected to the Merchandise Mart by a skywalk. The merchandise mart has fast food restaurants such as McDonalds, Dunkin Donuts and just window shopping was fun. You catch the brown line train right from the Merchandise Mart.

Service was good. When I needed toothpaste, they promptly brought it to my room.
Location of the hotel is convenient to transport, but about a mile walk from Union Square and not the best area.

"As a Gold member, I have stayed at my fair share of Hilton properties and this one is pretty disappointing to be honest. It seems they put minimal effort into renovating the hotel and it shows. I've always been a believer of the idea if you're going to do something, do it right. On a positive note though, the service is very Hilton like. Upon picking up my bags at PHL, the shuttle was there in less than ten minutes. The driver was friendly and got me to the front desk in no time. Check in was a breeze. After leaving the front desk, I explored the lobby a bit and made my way up to my room. I quickly noticed there was a strong odor throughout the hallways. Coupled with the very dated hallways, I really began to question whether or not I was at a Hilton. Thankfully, when I entered my room, the smell was gone and the first impression of the room was quite impressive. The carpet was nice, bathroom nicely appointed, comfortable bed, and a workstation with an awesome chair. The HVAC unit appeared to be an original from when the hotel was built, but it worked fine. My only major concern with the room is that it is an electrical nightmare and possible fire hazzard waiting to happen. There are a lot of exposed cords connecting into dated power strips that are simply laying around on the floor not tucked away behind furniture or stapled to the wall. I have uploaded the pictures to Tripavisor so you can see just what I am talking about here. Dinner was nice, albeit expensive, but that's typical for a hotel. There's simply nothing else around in a reasonable distance. All in all, I would say this was an incredibly average Hilton. I would probably give the Embassy Suites or Hampton Inn a try next time I go through PHL.",neutral,en,1

Someone commented on the overpowering scent of the bath products. I agree. Even the soap was really strong.
Hotel is huge and is on 2 different blocks. I found it faster to just walk across the street than to try and navigate the skyway plus elevators/stairs. Conference rooms are a maze.
Plenty of bars to choose from. Kind of expensive, but you expect that. The Irish bar not only ran out of all IPA's but even ran out of Guinness (it was Friday night). The bar manager should be fired for that one (seriously, he should be fired). The food in the Irish bar was really good (Shepard's pie).

"came in and asked for a \""standard service\"". I expected an oil/filter change.. etc.. I also had a service-engine light on. The service manger didn't seem very interested, didn't ask me any questions, didn't do a look over of the vehicle, and didn't really seem like he gave a [insert bad word here] about my needs. Thats fine I guess, I figure I am just another customer getting an oil change. When the service was complete, I got a call from the tech and he reminded me that my check-engine light was on. I told him it was because the gas cap was left off and asked him to reset it. He informed me that he would need to \""schedule another service\"" and that my vehicle wouldn't be ready until 5PM that day?? That seems a bit strange to me. I knew why the light was on, and I told him. He said it didn't matter, I would need to schedule a service.. etc.. blah.. blah.. blah.. after this, I took the car to a small mechanic around the corner and he reset for me for 10 bucks.. done. This exemplifies the primary issue with car-dealerships like Freeway today. Consumers today have soooooo much information available to them. We know when our \""new\"" car is really broken because I can ask a mechanic on the web. We know when we are getting swindled because (again), I can ask a mechanic on one of the 10000 forums available to us on the web. I can go to AutoZone and find out why my check-engine light is on. We (the customers) are no longer willing to be (for lack of a better phrase), taken advantage of. We want things done with quality, in a reasonable amount of time, and from a company that wants us there. Services like a nice lobby with \""hair-cuts\"" or \""massages\"" (as with another dealership I won't use) are completely extraneous and unnecessary. Just give me a bottle of water, a comfortable chair and fast internet. I only come to Freeway for oil-changes, and only because it is the least expensive (I purchased my car there). Consumers are becoming more and more savvy every day. In my opinion, dealerships need to recognize this and respond appropriately.",negative,en,0

Tempe Market Place is the perfect spot to go when you need to go to a couple of stores, but don't want to run all over town. You can even hit up several traditional mall stores, but manage to run in and out much quicker than at the traditional malls. Parking near the The District can be a pain at times, but there almost always spots near the major stores along the outside. \n\nI also highly recommend Tempe Marketplace as a good spot for a cheap date night.

The boyfriend and I rolled in here on a whim since it looked less busy than usual. I love the look of the place. Small, cozy, lined with brick and warm colors. Loud, busy, but everyone seemed to be having a great time. \n\nWe started off with some bread, oil, and olives. All very good, but it's hard to go wrong with bread and oil. The pizza was where the real litmus test would be. We went for the Sonny Boy, Rosa, and the Wiseguy. The Wiseguy was sort of boring. The sausage didn't have great flavor and I usually love Schreiner's sausages. The Rosa was very interesting--not something I'd eat very tie but definitely worth seeing what the hyper is about. My favorite, the Sonny Boy. How can you go wrong with Salami and olives?\n\nI know there is an endless Cibo vs Bianco debate so I'll jump in to give my two cents. Both are excellent but I'll give Cibo a slight edge. I like the di Notte pizza at Cibo more than any pizza I had at Bianco. Also, I like the variety of things that you can get at Cibo. Although the small menu at Bianco works, I do wish there were more appetizers or desserts to choose from. \n\nI had a great time.

"So I didn't know that the W Seattle was undergoing serious renovation to the lobby, bar and restaurant. Had I known, I probably wouldn't have chosen to stay here. Not the fault of the hotel but of the conference organisers who booked the W as part of their package. So with this caveat.....
Very friendly staff, mostly helpful but not so much when I asked them why the bar was closed at 10pm. They had a makeshift bar and restaurant in the hotel. They made a great fuss about handing out this schedule on check in. In my room they had left a message for me to contact the front desk to ensure that I had received the schedule. But it was worthless. The bar closing time was midnight on the schedule but in reality, they were closing it whenever they wanted. What's was the point of the schedule?
Anyway....the room was good, nice smellies in the bathroom. Terrible view but it was away from the street and so relatively quiet. Nothing else to report really as I didn't really use any of the services.

"Bah. You know when you keep giving somewhere just another chance because it used to be good? Well, I think last night was the night I gave up. \n\nI used to love Khushi's in Victoria Street. It was a dramatic building, and I had some great food there. \n\nThen it burnt down, and they moved to a fairly boring cellar under the Pear Tree and - I don't know, seemed to lose their way. Sauces were boring and tasted 'out of a jar', and worse, the staff would positively force feed you to get you out fast. But I reasoned to myself that I had gone during the festival and at Christmas, and nowhere is at its best when it's so busy. \n\nFinally, Khushi has its new home, in Antigua Place at the top of Leith Walk. It's taken over a big space that used to be Massimo's (I miss Massimo's), and from the outside it looks bright and cheerful and the place-to-be. \n\nSo last night I called and asked for a reservation for four. They had a table, though we'd have to be out in 90 minutes. That seemed fair, we just wanted a quick meal. \n\nFrom the second we arrived, though, it all went wrong. We were shown into a bare 'overspill' room off to the side, harassed to order fast, and then the unsmiling waiter announced that he'd 'bring your starters and mains at the same time, because you have to be out soon'. Charming...\n\nAnd so he did, slapped everything down and off he went, to practise his lack of social skills on someone else. \n\nThe food was okay, I suppose - fish pakora were tasty, the veg pakora a bit dry for my liking. My tandoori monkfish - I've had it before there and loved it, but last night it was a bit overcooked. And... maybe not actually monkfish? The texture just wasn't quite right so I was suspicious. \n\nAnyway, we ate, we got full. Mostly it was basic British Indian food in over-creamy sauces. And we were finished long before the time they were due to throw us out.\n\nThere are too many good restaurants in Edinburgh to have to put up with actively rude service.

It made our experience less fun. \n\nNot the restaurants fault, but it's something to consider.\n\nNow, onto the next reason... Somehow, and for some reason, they did things out of order this time. They served the soup, the the shrimp and fried rice, then the salad, then the entree, and finally the vegetables.\n\nIssues with this: (1) Mostly because I am used to soup, salad, shrimp/rice, vegetables, entree, dessert. (2) They didn't serve dessert. It wasn't offered. Nobody asked for it, so I thought maybe they took the free ice cream off the menu. We did get ice cream because my daughter had a birthday. I've got to check on that for future reference. (3) My entree, (The Trio which has Filet Mignon, chicken and shrimp) was prepared first, alongside someones lobster. I was served all 3 of my meats before my daughter's entree was even started. Before I was halfway done my food was cold! This is not how it's ever been done. Plus, I don't think I actually got a filet this time. It was a pretty crappy cut of meat \n\nThen there was a consistency issue between the chef we got this time than any other time. This chef was stingy on the salt and soy sauce and butter. Which is ok in my book, but restaurants need to keep it consistent. \n\nLast reason, and this may have been done before and my husband never noticed, but they add a tip to your bill, even if it's just 2 of you. And it's a small line item. Nobody points it out. I happened to pay in cash and they gave me the kind of change you would get if you needed to leave a tip. Whether true or not, it appears they are trying to get extra tip out of the customer. And that's bad.\n\nWe'll give them one more shot before we write them off entirely. As I said, this was pretty good before.",negative,en,0

"You know what I think was cool about the 1950's? Diners, malt shops and juke joints! Jukeboxes! Drive-in movie theaters! Doo-wop! Rock-n-Roll! Googie/Psuedo-futuristic architecture! The adventures kids had back in those times! Oh, and candy stores of course!\n\nYou know what I think was disgusting about the 1950's? The willful ignorance that was rampant! The segregation! The racial violence and tension! The severe marginalization of women! The archaic family standards! The advent of suburbia and overly auto-dependent cities! McCarthyism! Terribly misguided public service announcements! The highly religious nature of America at the time! Oh, and the atrocious fashion!\n\nFunny how the bad things from that decade have more of an influence on present day society than the positive things.\n\nWell, let's focus on something positive! A modern day business that allows you to feel like a kid in a candy store, literally.\n\nTaffy? Check. Wax lips (I.E. ONE OF MY FAVES)? Check. Crazy flavors of bottled soda? Check. Old fashioned bubble gum? Check. Vintage posters and advertisements? Okay, those aren't necessarily a requirement for an authentic candy store. They're just there to enhance the experience. \n\nThis store is definitely the place to go if you are in search for those old-school rarities like moon pies, bottle caps, jawbreakers, big ol' lollipops and mary janes (the ganja-less peanut butter confections). You can even make a bag of penny candy!\n\nIt's not just the nostalgic candy, however. They also sell sweet treats that you never see in America. Think Ramune sodas and Hi-Chews from Japan, or Vivident gum from Italy. They also have the typical M&M's, Reese's and Coca-Cola for those of us who are less adventurous.\n\nThe Final Verdict\n\nPros:\nOld-fashioned candy store. \nPenny candy bags.\nVarious non-edible vintage items available. \nInternational/imported confections\n\nCons:\nNot daring enough, due to the fact they sell candy that can be found at Walgreen's, CVS, gas stations and Albertson's, all of which are within 1/4th of a mile in the vicinity of the place.\n\nSuggestions:\nInstall an old-fashioned soda fountain! Maybe you guys can take it a step further and open a malt shop next door too? *wishful thinking\n\nWill I return? Certainly.",neutral,en,1

"This is the 3rd Blueberry Hill restaurant I've been too and I'm not very fond of it at all. The service was very slow for no apparent reason. They just sat us, took about 5 minutes to bring over some menus, another 5 minutes to bring our drinks, then another 10 minutes to come take our orders. Mind you that there were only 4 other tables with customers because it was a midweek morning. If it were a weekend, the service would be totally understandable, but it was just annoying to watch the waitresses keep passing by us without taking our orders or refilling our cups. \n\nAside from the lazy service, the food was good (as usual). I had a Benedict, my mom had a spinach and cheese omelet, and my sister had huevos rancheros. All were very appetizing and huge in portion. The sauce they put on top of my Benedict was so flavorful and not too thick or watery. It was probably my favorite part of the dish. \n\nI only wish the service matched the quality of the food. Even with us saying goodbye and thank you to the employees on our way out, we didn't get a single response. Unfortunately, I have to give this place 2 stars instead of 4 because I've experienced way better service at other locations.",negative,en,0

"This is the absolute last time I'm staying in this hotel.
For the past four years, I've stayed here many times to visit my daughter and grandson. The place is ran down, quirky, but was always a quiet and affordable stay. Plus, you're willing to overlook small things to be close to family and not pay out the nose.
Always before, this was a family-friendly place. I felt comfortable having my grandson over for a visit and to swim in the pool with me before we went out to visit the sites of San Diego.
This time, we were faced with the most disturbing trend I've ever seen - every day from 12:30 to 6 p.m., they let anyone come in off the street and use the pool for $5 per person.
Imagine taking your grandson to swim in a pool that was packed with people who were NOT PAYING GUESTS... drinking.... cursing every other word... And I was never notified when I checked in that this was going to happen.
Then on top of that, we went out and brought sandwiches from a local restaurant to eat by the pool. We were told that we could not eat it by the pool, but we had to go up on the balcony instead. WE WERE PAYING GUESTS and had to move!!!! This was unreal and completely poor customer service.
I complained to the manager, who just said this was their policy. She was matter of fact and offered nothing to make me feel like a respected guest.",negative,en,0

Best spot for Chinese noodles in Las Vegas! The wait can be insane on weekends during lunch time. I've waited 30 min to an hour on Sundays for a table...usually if this is the case I'd just leave but my grandma absolutely loves this place. \n\nThis is not the nicest chinese restaurant that you'll find in Las Vegas but the food is great! They serve the usual entrees that you would find in most Chinese restaurants but their specialty is their delicious noodle soups and BBQ entrees. \n\nMy go-to order here is a bowl of wonton egg noodle soup with the thin noodles with a side of chinese brocolli that is served with oyster sauce. These items sound simple but always leaves me satisfied and happy as can be. Their roast pork is delicious as well. I usually would avoid eating the skin of pork but that would be a sin here.\n\nMost of the employees speak both Chinese and Vietnamese which I found pretty impressive. Their English is for the most part...broken..so be patient...you won't regret it. The food and affordable prices will have you coming back time and time again.,positive,en,2

"My Complaint:
I booked two rooms at this hotel via Hotwire over a month before our trip ($108 per room, including taxes & fees). My husband and I were traveling with another couple and only planned to stay one night in Hollywood before heading south for a wedding. Our plane from Honolulu arrived at LAX about 6pm and we drove around the area exploring for awhile before checking into the hotel at 8pm. The front desk clerk informed me that he only showed a reservation for one room (and didn’t care at all that I had a print-out of my confirmation with Hotwire showing two PREPAID rooms). He said they were sold out for the evening and the four of us could share one room or we could try the Travelodge down the street. He also said he didn’t see our reservation as being prepaid. No manager on duty to assist us.
We ended up sharing the one room and I called Hotwire to refund the cost of the other (no problems on that side). In the morning the front desk clerk (the same guy – they sure do work long hours!) confirmed that our room was already paid and said another room had opened up later that night, but he didn’t want to disturb us since it was late. Um, okay. Thanks for letting me know after the fact. He tried to charge us for the parking ($9 I think) and I told him there was no way I was paying for that when they gave away one of our rooms – the LEAST they could do was comp it. He said he didn’t have the authority. It wasn’t until after I asked to speak to the manager he finally got up and went to ask for authorization to comp.
Other Details:
Our first floor room was fine. Not a bad size - two double beds, small couch and coffee table, mini fridge and microwave. Clean. Fairly quiet. View of parking lot.
Elevator down to breakfast area was unbearably slow (5 minutes both ways, seriously). They need a set of stairs nearby or something.
Breakfast wasn’t great, but it was free so I can’t really complain. When we were there they were out of forks, juice glasses, and syrup. Eggs and croissants were gross, but there was plenty of juice, milk, cereal, toast, waffles, and sausages that were fine.
Area was somewhat seedy, but if you’re driving it’s fine. Don’t expect to walk to Hollywood or any other sites of interest – it’s quite a ways and not a pretty walk.
Parking was being renovated or something nearest to the hotel, so it was hard to find a stall. When we returned from sightseeing at around 11:30pm we got the last stall and it was >tight<!
We didn’t see the pool area, but the courtyard area in the center of the hotel looked nice.

"Not great, not terrible, but three thumbs up for that TORTILLA SOUP!\n\nI recall being 13 and thinking Islands was this fancy place with fancy burgers. I'm now not 13 anymore and have been set straight. Not my first choice to eat here but after a 3-hour hike with only a Cliff bar in my stomach, anything that wouldn't give me food poisoning was sounding pretty good at the time. \n\nI went with their limited edition burger whose name escapes me. The burger was tasty enough. Seemed like there was too much liquid in all those toppings. It tasted good but the bun got soggy real quick. Speaking of buns, you have a choice here! White or Wheat? And for my non-red-meat consuming friends, you can sub your beef patty with a turkey one. If you have a french-fry obsession like myself, you will love Islands unlimited french fries. The first batch that comes with your burger is relatively big. But the additional orders get smaller as you continue ordering. I believe they hand-cut their fries here. Think along the taste of In-n-Out fries with a thicker cut and longer fry.\n\nMy brother's friend had his heart set on the tortilla soup here. The hike started and ended with a tortilla soup discussion. In total, I can imagine we spent at least 30 minutes discussing this tortilla soup so my brother and I shared a bottomless one. I don't think that's allowed... but if you do share try to be stealthy about it and don't ask for a second spoon? All in all the tortilla soup was the star of the evening. It doesn't have that processed pre-packaged soup taste (but for all I know it might be). It has a homemade quality to it. It's really very delicious with little strings of melted cheese. If I come here again I'll probably skip the burgers and go all-in on that unlimited soup.\n\nAlso noteworthy is the Longboard beer. It's served ice ice ice cold. Tiny little icicles form on the top. It would probably be more refreshing on a hot day but it was still enjoyable after that freezing a** hike.",negative,en,0

Went with a group of friends so I got to taste a bit of everything so here's my 2 cents: actually, I'm not gonna waste time talking about other dishes...\n\nCut to the chase- here's what to order: Fried Pizza Dough, Caprese Salad, Braised Pork Shoulder with Smashed Fried Potatoes and Sauteed Squash.\n\nPizza Dough: Curiously shaped these strips of fried dough have the perfect chewy texture and is topped with shaved cheese and pepper flakes. Simple yet addicting =)\n\nCaprese Salad: Yummy tomato slices with this soft gooey mozzarella like cheese on top! It was so good I would play bloody knuckles for the last slice =)\n\nBraised Pork Shoulder: Huge, thick piece of pork meat that's so tender and soft that is glazed with this delicious apple reduction and cucumber slices. Honestly, the pork was so good I didn't even realize there were cucumbers on that pig! \n\nThe sides were AMAZING: Fried Smashed Potatoes were something new that I'm a fan of....little red potatoes baked soft but the outside is lightly fried and crispy with this incredible salty slightly spicy kick! Zucchinis were sauteed in butter and garlic- enough said!\n\nWhat NOT to order: Pizza (why waste $ on something you can everyday?!), Butternut Squash appetizer (tasted flowery), pasta margherita DOC (it was too salty).\n\nMy friend had a bite of my pork and said, \""Ohhh, the chef made love to that dish!\"" and my reply was, \""If that's the case this pork had some multiple O's!\"" Seriously guys, it was TOO GOOD!\n\n*sigh* Now I'm sad....talking about this restaurant and being 3 hours away sucks.\n\nIf you're in Vegas please try San Marco out.

"We booked the Allerton Hotel for 4 nights in August through Hotwire. The rate was comparable to the rate we received last year through Hotwire, but last year we were booked at the Drake.
It would be unfair to compare the Allerton to the Drake, but after staying at the Drake for nearly the same amount, it was hard not to draw comparisons, or at least to not be slightly disappointed.
The Allerton is in a great location, for any attractions on or near the Miracle Mile. That is a positive, the down side is you can hear much of the noise form Michigan Ave. We were in a room within earshot of some young street musicians playing plastic buckets and pails and it made it dissicult to nap late in the afternoon.
The first room we were assigned was extremely small and the carpet was horribly stained with what looked like red wine or coffee ( I hope ) the vents for the heating and ac were covered in filthy dust and mold.
The front desk changed our romm, and the new room was a bit larger, but the vents in that room were pretty dirty as well. The front desk must not have notified housekeeping of the cahnge, so we were dismayed to return to our room to after a long day in the city, to find it had not been cleaned.
If you go into the Allerton knowing it is an older hotel, in need of many updates and refreshing then this hotels is very adequate for a good location, comfortable bed and good water pessure.
The downside to the comfortable bed is an extremely loud ac unit that will jar you awake every time it turns on, paper thin walls that allow lot of corridor and nearby rooms to be heard.
Hotwire ranks this as a 3.5 star hotel. I would not. I would put it closer to 2.5 and possibly a 3 star.
I did not check out the fitness facility, nor did we eat at the hotel. With so many great places to eat within walking distance it seemed silly to spend the money the hotel prices reflected.

This is the standard charge if you want the delivery within a 4 hour window on the day of delivery - £55 was nearly 20% of the dishwasher cost.

I am accustomed to staying in places for longer stays on business trips so the initial size of the room was a little bit of a shock, but really what do you need if you are just looking for a clean and comfortable room with a hot shower to get you through the night? The first room we were put in had a few issues - the light in the bathroom and the phone didn't work, but that was quickly resolved by moving to another room. All in all I will definitely stay at a Microtel in the future, and would recommend it highly if you are looking for a good value.",neutral,en,1

"This enjoyable minor noir boasts a top cast, and many memorable scenes. The big distraction is the complete disregard for authentic accents. The Spanish characters in the film are played by a Frenchman (Boyer), a Belgian (Francen), a Greek (Paxinou) and a Hungarian (Lorre)! And to top it all off Bacall is supposed to be an English aristocrat! Despite these absurdities, the performances are all very good - especially those of Paxinou and Lorre. But the scene in which Boyer, Paxinou and Lorre meet, and talk in wildly different accents, is a real hoot! And I guess, seeing as how they were alone, that they should actually have been speaking in Spanish anyway! It seems pretty weird that the Brothers Warner couldn't find any Spanish speaking actors in Los Angeles! Of course Hollywood has often had an ""any old accent will do"" policy - my other favorite is Greta Garbo (Swedish) as Mata Hari (Dutch), who falls in love with a Russian soldier played by a Mexican (Ramon Novarro). Maybe they should have got Novarro for ""Confidential Agent"" - he would have been great in Boyer's role or at least in Francen's (which would have saved greatly on the dark make-up budget).",positive,en,2

"First of all. I do not look down on Americans. I know lots of people that are intelligent people from the USA. But this Movie is so utterly bad, that i just had to comment on it.First of all...Movies are mostly far from the truth. This movie is no exception. Lots of scene's are so incredibly false. For example the departure of the 2 space ships. You see them drop off the full tanks in space. Just a small distance from each other. Remember what caused the space shuttle to explode in the past ? Just a tinsy winsy part that came off. In here it is just common to drop fuel tanks that are as big if not bigger then the whole ship. What idiot would let 2 spaceships lift up and do that at the same time ??? Second of it is that the Russian station is a piece of (s)crap. I hate to bring this up to you, but astronauts nowadays go to Russia. Since their equipment is much more reliable then NASA's. The Space Shuttle is retired. And NASA uses it just to pay off the bills. And there is no better alternative for it. And the list of whoppers goes on and on. This is truly an insult to people that do take space travel serious. And i know half as much as these guys do. But the most annoying part ( read: the whole movie ) is the Propaganda and patriot crap that u get choked with. MY GOD !!!! I thought i was looking at a CNN business commercial for like an hour. The actors solve their petty problems by shooting at each other, giving the middle finger to everyone they come face to face with, start up fights, ignore the police, etc, etc... But when it comes to their love for their country and sacrificing their lives, suddenly everyone stands in line to commit suicide for it ( bomb detonator ) ?? Maybe i lack the feeling of being a true ""Patriot"", that can sing the national anthem backwards in Swahili. Whilst riding with George Bush behind the steering wheel of a golf cart, driving in circles until the battery is empty. But this movie was too much for me too handle. And when i finally got hold and pulled the flag pole and fabric of the American flag out of my hiney. I realised that i was glad this movie was finally done. I do not know why so much good actors participated in this narrow minded, stereotyping, propaganda movie. But i pity them. This represents a country where you can get away with murder if you have money or power. As long as ""Uncle Sam"" thinks you are a good patriot. Where everyone is happy as long as it is another country that has been devastated, no one cares.",negative,en,0

"We thoroughly enjoyed our two-night stay at Stanford Court last week. Our 4th-floor room was clean, appealing, and comfortable with a pleasant view of the city and the bay. Service was always available, efficient, and responsive but never intrusive. The location is ideal for walkers (we walked to Chinatown, North Beach, shopping areas and theater), but the hotel is located at the intersection of the 2 cable car lines for those who don't feel like negotiating the hills. Taxis were easy to find also.
Fournou's Oven Restaurant is downstairs and our dinners were fabulous. Breakfast is good but way overpriced ($22 for the ""American Breakfast""), but the coffee is excellent and a bowl of oatmeal or granola with fruit would be a more reasonable choice. There are numerous cafes nearby in the local neighborhoods.
We highly recommend Stanford Court for its comfortable beds and perfect location for exploring San Francisco.",positive,en,2
"I've been coming here for quite a while now, probably like 3 years and I love this place. It's my only go to sushi place, I'm always down to try others but this pne is just my favorite. I'm a huge salmon person so I'm pretty picky on fresh salmon and their salmon is always amazing. The sex bomb roll is definitely the best roll. They have a great variety of rolls, all which are delicious. Nigiri is always awesome, it just slides in your mouth so deliciously. The desserts are great, especially the actual ice cream. The cherry and mocha flavored ice creams are soo good! I think one of my favorite things is that they give you a stamp card for AYCE, not many places do that. You fill up your stamp card and on your 10th order, you get an Ayce lunch or dinner. Here's a tip: if you bring several friends that do AYCE as well but don't have their own stamp card, they'll give you stamps on your card counting them as well. I have filled mine up several times this way ;) service is always good and if a server hasn't came around there's also a button on your table that you can push to get your waiter to come by. \nIf you're going on a weekend night before 11pm, expect about an hr wait, but pretty much any other time the wait is short. =)",positive,en,2

We had the chili cheddar burger and the veggie hash. Great presentation. Both of us remarked how they were kind of bland - not bad, but they just didn't have a lot of seasoning or flavor, maybe not enough spices, or maybe ingredients that weren't ripe? I pulled about half of the bread off the burger and added pepper and then I could taste some spice in the chili burger. To be fair, I asked them to hold the mayo so maybe that's where all the flavor was?

Our room could not have been cleaner and the tempur-pedic mattress was extremely comfortable. The only thing I wasn't thrilled about was the walk to the old city area (i.e. Independence Hall, Liberty Bell) it was over 20 blocks. The walk down Chestnut St. is very nice and we passed a lot of great restaurants and places to have a coffee, which made the walk more enjoyable. We took a taxi once but it was around $10, which to me was a waste of money. We didn't try the two on-site restaurants or The Coffee Bar because the majority of our day was spent in a different part of the city, but they looked nice.
The hotel was beautiful and I also got the room for a great price through an online travel website. The Rittenhouse Square area is very trendy and packed with great little shops and restaurants. If you are going to Philadelphia to see the historic attractions that Philly is know for then this hotel is a little far from that area.
